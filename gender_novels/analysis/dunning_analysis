#Dunning Analysis

**This markdown contains a write up of 
the dunn_individual_word and dunning_total files**

The code used for this analysis can be found in dunning.py under the 
analysis folder.

The statistical model used to analyze the distinctiveness of words
is called Dunning Log-Likelihood, and it calculates how distinct a word
is in its own corpus. This is a very effective way to analyze the word 
usage of authors, as it returns words that are not only distinctive
by sheer amount but also significantly distinctive.
This means that words with relatively low frequencies can still receive high 
dunning scores when compared to the rest of the words in their respective
corpus. The function dunn_individual_word applies the mathematical formula
used in Dunning Log-Likelihood and returns a dunning value for that specific word.
As inputs, it takes in the total amount of words in both counter objects,
and it also takes in the total counts of the desired word in their respective counters.

**How to Use dunning_total**
 
 All that is needed to run dunning_total is two counter objects (counter1
 and counter2), mapping
 words to the amount of times it appears. When the function is ran,
 it will execute dunn_individual_word on all of the common words 
 in both counters. It will then return a dictionary that maps that word to its dunning
 score. The negative end of the spectrum denotes the distinctiveness
 of the word in counter2, while the positive end of the spectrum does the 
 same for counter1.
