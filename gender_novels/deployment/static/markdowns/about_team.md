# About

The Gender Novels project began in Fall 2018 with an undergraduate cohort of students working with a faculty director and two postdocs as part of the Digital Humanities program at MIT. Everyone involved listed below have contributed to the projectâ€™s design, development, implementation, contextualization, and maintenance.

Students participated as part of one of three groups: Data, Analysis, and Deployment. Each contributor had an individual role as part of this work, and they collaborated across teams to develop the Gender Novels project. Read more about their contributions on the [team roles page](team_roles).
