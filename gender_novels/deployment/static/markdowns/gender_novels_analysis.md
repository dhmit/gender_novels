# Analysis
We ran programs looking at the relative frequencies of male pronouns compared to female pronouns 
used by authors at different time periods. The higher the frequency, the more male pronouns there 
were compared to the number of female pronouns.

We found this to be the most interesting piece of data. There is a significant 
difference in the male pronouns used by male authors compared to female authors. 
While female authors use pronouns such as "she" and "her" more often, they still show
a male bias.

The above graph shows that there is no initial trend that can be drawn between these ratios and a
specific time period. However, there seem to be spikes in the 1830s and the 1880s. Due to the 
currently somewhat small sample size of novels, it is difficult to know if these spikes are 
statistically significant or simply flukes.
