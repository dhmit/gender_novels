# Male/Female Instance Distance Analysis

The code used for this analysis can be found in [instance\_distance\_analysis.py](https://github\.com/dhmit/gender_novels/blob/master/gender_novels/analysis/instance_distance_analysis.py).

The raw analysis returns a dictionary with each novel mapped to an array of 3 lists:
* Median, mean, minimum, and maximum distances between male pronoun instances.
* Median, mean, minimum, and maximum distances between female pronoun instances.
* For each of the above stats, the difference between male and female values. (male stat- female stat for all stats). 
*positive difference values* mean there is a *larger distance between male pronouns than female pronouns* and therefore 
*higher female frequency*.
 
For example:
>A median female instance value of 14.0 vs a median male instance distance value of 10.0 means that female instances tend 
tend to occur every 14 words in the novels versus male instances occurring every 9 words in the novel. This would indicate 
a greater male presence in the novel.
> A mean difference value of 4.0 means that on average, the distance between male instances is 4 words longer than female 
instances.

## Thoughts:
Overall, both male and female authors have greater median female instance distances than male instance distances. 
However, there is a significant difference between median female instance distance in novels written by female authors,
and those written by male authors. Tthere is evidently no significant trend with relation to date or location of
publication. 

Looking at the list of top-10 novels in each measured category, it is important to note that the highest male instance distances
are far smaller than the highest female instance distance. The top 10 median male instance distances are in the range of 
30-45, while the top 10 median female instance distances are in the range of 5091-19713. This may indicate that even the female-centric novels still have a male
presence, while male-centric novels exclude female characters to a greater degree.
