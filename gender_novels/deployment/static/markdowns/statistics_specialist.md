# Note on Statistics

Due to the imbalanced process of collecting novels at the start of the project - in which each 
member of the data group found nine novels whose authors’ last initials were one of three certain
letters - it should be observed that the final analysis may be skewed towards authors with 
obscure first initials. Concerns about the accuracy of that analysis of only one hundred, 
non-randomized novels was one factor in the data group’s decision to acquire thousands of 
novels to analyze rather than the initial hundred.

The lab used NumPy and SciPy statistical functions to analyze the statistical significance of the 
group’s results. Preliminary tests on a smaller sample of novels found most results to be 
insignificant when compared to metadata such as publication year or author gender. However, 
performing the same statistical tests on the full data set have revealed different results.
