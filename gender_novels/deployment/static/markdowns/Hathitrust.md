# HathiTrust
Throughout this project, the MIT DH lab explored corpora other than Gutenberg, the one it ultimately ended up using exclusively. One of the main corpora it considered was HathiTrust, which was valuable not only for the size of its collection, but also for the ease with which books could be scraped from it. 

In preparation for this branch of the project the DH lab conducted research about how Hathitrust is used and navigated, studied a [previously conducted project](https://tedunderwood.com/2015/08/07/a-dataset-for-distant-reading-literature-in-english-1700-1922/) that also used HathiTrust, and learned about the corpus’ terms of use and copyright. 

In addition to research about the corpus itself, the lab also researched the challenges and complications of going from a small sample size of 100 to a much larger one of about 10,000, as the lab initially intended to use Gutenberg for the former and Hathitrust for the latter. Some potential complications discovered included difficulty of bias elimination (it’s harder to check 10,000 books for outliers or non-novels than it is to check 100), program efficiency, and processing power. 

Although the Hathitrust corpus didn’t end up being used, the knowledge obtained from its research was invaluable to the process of expanding the Gutenberg corpus from 100 to 4,200 novels.
