## Countries of Publication

![](images/country_of_publication.png "Countries of Publication")

The code that generated “Country of Publication for Gutenberg” has a threshold for which 
countries are shown. Countries shown on the graph published greater than or equal to one percent 
of the total books used for this research. From this graph, it can be found that a majority of 
the books from the Gutenberg corpus were published in either the United States or the United 
Kingdom. This can be explained by the fact that the United States and United Kingdom have one of 
the highest concentration of English speakers. Additionally, Project Gutenberg was founded in the 
United States which may have an influence on the proportion of books from the United States.


## Publication Years

From the “Publication Year Concentration for Gutenberg” graph, there is an exponentially 
increasing frequency of books per year in the Gutenberg corpus from 1771 to 1921. As printing 
became cheaper over time, publishing became cheaper along with it, and this may explain the 
exponential growth. When printing was more expensive, only books that were deemed "publishing 
material" were published, and as it became cheaper, the standard for published material 
decreased, allowing for a wider range of books to be put into publication.

## Gender Breakdown

The gender breakdown is about two-thirds male which should be considered when looking at the 
analysis of the Gutenberg corpus.
