# Basic Pronoun Frequency Analysis

The code used for this analysis can be found in [gender\_pronoun\_freq_analysis.py](https://github
.com/dhmit/gender_novels/blob/master/gender_novels/analysis/gender_pronoun_freq_analysis.py).

The code initially returns the relative frequency of male pronouns to female pronouns. The numbers given here are relative frequency of female pronouns. Thus, the higher the number, the more times female pronouns were used vs male pronouns in the book.
 
For example:
> A frequency of 0.4 means that 40% of the gendered pronouns in that book were female and 60% of the gendered pronouns were male.
 
The numbers listed here are means over their respective categories.

significantly higher frequency of female pronouns over male authors.
