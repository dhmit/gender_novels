 EXCURSIONS IN
 VICTORIAN BIBLIOGRAPHY


                  “If it is true that the Victorian
                  time was ugly and vulgar, the
                  excitement of those years between
                  1848 and 1890 was something like
                  that of a religious revival.”

This book is so essentially an accumulation of notes and so emphatically
wanting in the qualities of completeness and learning proper to genuine
bibliography that I have sought, even on the title-page, to indicate its
limitations. It were indeed presumption to enter the field of
nineteenth-century bibliography, in which already so much fine and
skilful work has been accomplished, with the slight technical equipment
to which I may lay claim. On the other hand, the experience of
collectors conforms oddly to type, and where, in the study of certain
Victorian first editions, I have found perplexity and doubt, others in
the same study will likely find them too. Wherefore my annotations, in
this book set in order and to a certain point rounded off, should help
my fellow-students to a speedier knowledge of points and pitfalls in the
collecting of their favourites than was easily accessible to myself. In
time (maybe in short time) my work will be superseded by investigation
more accomplished, by analysis more detailed. At such time collectors
(and myself among them) will rightly substitute for this volume on their
shelf of bibliographies the later, more comprehensive, handbooks that
shall have taken its place. Meanwhile I dare to hope that the present
work, with all its shortcomings, will find appreciative users, and among
them a few who, realizing the difficulties that even so modest a
compilation has been forced to surmount, will forgive its imperfections
for the sake of its attributes.

                  *       *       *       *       *

With the general propriety of book-collecting I am not here concerned.
Men there are to whom all collecting is folly; others to whom every
passion is vile. To the logical asceticism of their private Utopias they
are welcome, provided the lover be left to enjoy his mistress, the
lepidopterist his butterflies, the bibliophile his books. Even the more
subtle critic, who admits the lure of collecting but maintains that the
craze of the first edition is senseless hysteria, shall not tempt me to
dispute. This is a book about first editions, and will be read only by
the initiate. If we be hystericals, we have at least our weakness in
common. Let us therefore shut the door and compare symptoms, for we are
all fools together.

The superior and the sceptical are now excluded from the privacy of our
imaginary club-house. But a further reservation must be made. Although
it were impractical idealism to demand that the collector transcend in
his collecting every sordid consideration of market and fluctuating
value, it is reasonable to look askance at the mere speculator. From the
scope of this word I exclude, of course, the whole fraternity of
booksellers. They exist frankly for the marketing of books; and who
shall grudge them the profits of their toil? My animadversion is against
the private person to whom rare books are mere scrip, to be bought and
sold by telephone, their very titles meaningless, their contents utterly
unknown. No doubt, if this book is of service at all, it will be of
service incidentally to individuals of the kind described. That it
should be so is unpreventable. But on the general ethics of collecting
the compiler may be allowed the consolation of bearing his trivial
testimony. The private collector who buys what he likes to read merits
such reward as wise buying may earn for him. He, however, who buys by
rote, puts away and resells, is no collector at all, but rather a
trespasser on the preserves of the bookseller, taking advantage of a
noble trade while sharing none of its burdens.

With this dictum I descend from the august to the particular.
Collecting, collecting books, collecting first editions of books—all
these are postulates. At this point is a parting of the ways. The
frontiers of dispute now lie across our path; for within the bounds of
the realm of first editions are to be found divergent tastes,
conflicting fancies, all the clamour and thrust of an enthusiasm that
grows ever more complex.

The collecting of first editions is, in its present form, a diversion of
recent growth. Fifty years ago amateurs of books were few in number and,
necessarily, rich in gold, for only the great books of past literature
were regarded as fit material for collection, and great books, though
cheaper then than now, were never to be had for love. But the passage of
time has transformed, in another way than that of mere numbers, the
community of book-collectors. Not only are there nowadays more
collectors and a greater variety of books collected, but there has come
to its own the great principle of _original condition_. This is not so
pale a platitude as to many it will appear. A few book-buyers there have
always been to whom original binding, original end-papers, uncut edges,
incidental advertisements, errata slips, and half-titles have meant
perfection. But they were rare exceptions. To the large majority a first
edition was a book of a certain date without “Second” or “New Edition”
on its title-page. Buyers of this school were indifferent to the
disfigurement of library labels on side or end-paper; gave no thought to
errata slips; but shaved their favourites, fore-edge and tail, dressed
them in uniform calf gilt, affixed a bookplate, and went their way.

Such collectors as these are still amongst us, but they are now awaking
to the folly of their past. The market—that indisputable witness to
human taste—gives hard but practical proof of their wrongdoing. “Good
and original condition” is nowadays three-quarters of a book's value,
and the fraction, if it alters at all, will with the passage of time
increase rather than decrease.

Is it too much to hope that the importance of original condition has now
been permanently realized? The change, if it has really been effected,
is in the main a healthy one. Although—for it is undeniable—the craze
for the fine copy has produced its own extremism; although there are
to-day book-lovers who refuse even to open the pages of their books
lest, by such violation, they unsuit them for a mart in which,
conventionally enough, virginity is value; although advance prospectuses
and dust jackets of contemporary publications have scrupulously to be
preserved in order that a “set” be genuinely complete—the desire for a
book _as issued_ does at least argue a consciousness of its individual
personality. Standard authors, be they ancient or modern, can be
purchased in calf by telephone and at so much per yard; but the
obtaining of shelf furniture in original cloth is a matter of much
seeking and of progress measured in fractions of an inch.

It has seemed well thus to emphasize the importance of “condition” to
the modern book-collector, because “condition” in the case of such
authors as those here examined is their admirer's greatest problem, and
because the few bibliographies that already exist, while listing dates
of publication and in one case at least supplying adequate collation of
the various volumes, do not provide any real description of the
externals of those volumes when in original state.

This description I have endeavoured to supply. That my work contains
errors of omission I am certain; that it be free from errors of
commission I may hardly dare to hope. But the trouble I have had even to
arrive thus far on the way to completeness encourages belief that some
portion of the donkey work may now be regarded as done for good and all,
and that the trained minds of bibliographers proper may, if they
incline, turn their talent to such refinements of detail as surely
underlie many of the books herein examined.

                  *       *       *       *       *

To the collecting of first editions of Victorian novelists I came by the
honourable way of literary liking. Brought up on Jane Austen, Scott, and
Dickens, I read, during my years of flapperdom, Marryat, Trollope, and
Wilkie Collins. Oxford and the audacities of undergraduate curiosity
estranged me from all save the last quarter of the nineteenth century.
While many of my contemporaries made sour sacrifice at the altars of
disillusion, feeding their pessimism on Gissing and Butler, their taste
for paradox on Bernard Shaw, I sought disreputable refuge among fleshly
symbolists. The children of Baudelaire and Poe jostled the faint
offspring of Gaelic legend on my shelves, and, while the voluptuous
pallor of tuberoses shone against blue wall-paper, imagination floated
on the dim tide of decadence. Came reaction as swift and irrational as
were inevitable. From Paris echoed the clash of neo-barbarism, and
before the strident onslaught of the rediscovered primitive the faint
elegance of a pose too exhausted even for sin dissolved in air. They
were great days, those early days of the new brutality. Blues and mauves
gave place to orange checked with black, to vivid greens, to fierce
outrageous reds. From the scented secrecy of lamplit boudoirs the young
intellectual rushed into the wind and sunshine, and he who once made
tired love to Phryne on a couch of silk now clipped the milkmaid grossly
in a ditch. The way of other tastes went taste in letters and in art.
After d'Annunzio, Synge; after Verlaine, Verhaeren; after Pater, Hardy;
after Rops and Carrière, Gauguin and the rest.

For a while all was well. Cubism, a false interpretation of the
synthetic doctrine of Cézanne, began its brief and rigid reign. Painters
and writers fled naturalism in a search for true reality. Some are still
wandering, drearily absurd, in the desert of their own bleak imaginings.
The rest found reality, truly enough and rapidly enough—in war.

And now war has passed, leaving a world weary of fact and fever, weary
of striving, weary almost of its own ideals. For long enough yet will
persist turbulent discomfort and the clamour of quacks hawking the
millennium; but at last will be peace, and it is surely a longing for
that peace that has turned men's minds partly to high romance, but more
generally to the manners and genius of a century ago. Those of an older
generation than my own have, perhaps, never betrayed their gentle
Victorian heritage. One may envy and applaud their wisdom. But we
prodigals, returned from our rioting and sick with the husks of a démodé
violence, stoop to any self-abasement, to any denial of our own past
judgment, so we be allowed entry to the quiet courts and ordered
opulence of the age we once affected to despise. Literary enthusiasm
expresses itself in various ways. For my part to love an author is to
collect him, for I can read no borrowed books, and only with difficulty
such as are not first editions. Of the absurdity of this I am cheerfully
aware. We have each one of us our foible, and this is mine. Considered
broadly it is harmless enough, less cruel than killing birds, less
degrading than drink. Naturally, however, it cannot be indulged to more
than limited degree. Shakespeare and Sterne and Keats and Browning I may
own, but in reprint. And so with many another. But to the extent
possible in fact and a little beyond that permissible in money, I have
contrived, from one phase to another, to keep myself fairly supplied
with “reading firsts.” A decadent, I collected Verlaine and Mallarmé,
Rimbaud and the Anglo-Irish nineties; a neo-primitive, I bought Synge
and Verhaeren, Conrad and the chief Georgian poets of the new
simplicity. And so matters progressed, while gradually novels ousted
poetry from my shelves, and, again gradually, from the reading of modern
novels I came once more to Trollope and the writers of his age.

                  *       *       *       *       *

It is not until one undertakes seriously the collecting of the
less-known Victorian novelists that one realizes how prime the sport
that their assembling offers, how destitute of guide-posts is the maze
of their work. In the capacity of quarry few authors or groups of
authors can rival those with whom this volume deals. The essence of
collecting is the chase. The buyer of world-famous rarities, of which
the whereabouts is trumpeted abroad, knows nothing of the thrill of that
dusky provincial bookshop, among whose tumbled piles Victorians must
surely lurk. The dapper expert in ingenious moderns with his prefaces,
his cancel-titles, his censored (but disappointing) curiosa, his “works”
and “limiteds,” can set one joy alone against my dozen. He may, if the
gods be kind, on the shelves of bookshops proper find books that were
bought for new, but have not sold and still remain, lacking an entry to
the world of second-hand, still fresh, still offered at the published
price. But in the main his life is one of “inside information”; his ally
in the trade sells books instead of making them; it is the principle of
the turf in terms of Whatman paper and grey Michalet boards. To the
collector of Victorians (exception made, of course, of Dickens's parts,
of _Wuthering Heights_, of _Desperate Remedies_, of other far reputed
treasures) belongs neither the pursuit of “folios” across the world nor
the click of the tape pegging out details of obscure pamphlets. Copies
of three-volume novels by writers of reputation are hard to find at all,
and very hard in anything of condition. Nevertheless, when found, they
are often cheap. And then, when one is bought, there comes the reading
of it.

And yet at times the collector feels forlorn and without guidance, for
maybe the book he buys is a little known one, of which the very name is
strange. Indeed, the lack of pointers obtrudes harshly, and in a sense
no less literary than bibliographical. Not only is information as to
actual titles scarce and unreliable, but among the great number of these
writers' books the student must perforce read his own way to a sense of
relative quality. At the cost of some hours of tedium and of many
mistaken purchases I have arrived at a general knowledge of what these
novelists wrote, when they wrote it, and what it looked like when it
first appeared. This knowledge is herein set out for the possible
assistance of all and sundry.

The relative value as literature or as story-telling of their many books
makes more perilous judgment. I am no expert in comparative literature.
I cannot even claim to have read all or nearly all the books that are,
in the pages following, materially dissected. I have preferred therefore
to make no pretence to serious literary criticism, but have contented
myself with indicating at the beginning of each section the general
character of the work of the writer in question, into what groups (if
any) his novels fall, and have called attention here and there to
certain little known or unknown stories that have pleased me and may,
though hardly for that reason, please some of my contemporaries. Where
an author has little attraction for me, I have said so. Books of all
kinds are listed between these covers, and no single being will enjoy
them all. But this is certain: that among them the inquirer, be his
tastes what they may, will find reading to soothe him and to stimulate;
will come to seek in the solidity, whether downright, fantastic, or
lurid, in the quiet charm, in the dexterous sincerity of good Victorian
fiction, a satisfaction of spirit produced by the novels of no other
period of English literature.

Those who for years have known and pondered these Victorian tales will
smile contemptuously at such pompous revelation of a stale secret. To
them, in scorn of self and lest they lose any of that pleasurable pride
allowable to old initiates who watch a novice at his scourgings, I offer
the apology that is my book. Others, arrogant in knowledge of
Dickensiana, in possession of priceless Borrows, of Jane Austen perfect
in her boards, will turn from this humble chronicle of humble writers
with the bored serenity of a brass hat on his way to conference. To them
I make obeisance, wondering secretly whether great collections were
amassed more joyfully than my little one. Last of all, however, may come
a few, to whom, as to me, Trollope is balm and meat at once, who love
three volumes of a novel for their very spacing and ornate
expansiveness, who find shelves of cloth or labelled triplets more
beautiful than any other shelves, to whom, in short, the collection and
the reading of Victorian first editions is romance and quiet happiness.
To them my book with all its faults will come kindly and joyfully, for
they will welcome in it the voice of one who thinks and loves, as they
do, the plaint of one suffering from the same sweet sickness as
themselves.




      A NOTE ON THE TERMS USED IN THE BIBLIOGRAPHIES WHICH FOLLOW

      TOGETHER WITH OBSERVATIONS RELATIVE TO VICTORIAN BOOKMAKING,
RECOMMENDATIONS TO COLLECTORS, AND AN APPEAL TO THE EXPERIENCE OF OTHER
                 STUDENTS FOR ASSISTANCE AND CORRECTION


(i) I am aware that bibliographers proper designate by means of upright
strokes the alignment of wording on the title-pages of books subject to
their analysis. This mannerism I have eschewed, and for two reasons. In
the first place, a bibliography so displayed baffles the inexpert reader
by a suggestion of mathematical obscurity. Tempted by the desire to
attract a few such readers to a book that, for all its overplus of sinew
and lack of flesh, is in intention a tribute to a group of very human
and consoling writers, I have sought an appearance of readability at the
cost of a small technical sacrifice. The sacrifice _is_ small—and here
lies the second justification of my heterodox technique—because no
variety of any one of the books hereafter listed depends either on the
alignment of title-page wording or (save in a single case to which
attention is specially drawn) on the phrasing, absence or presence of a
note of reservation of foreign or dramatic rights. In short, that which
is required for the identification of a first edition I have given; but
beyond that—nothing.

(ii) The first editions of almost any author include, in addition to
books written wholly by him, a number of works for some part of which
only he is responsible. These secondary items cannot be neglected by
collectors, for any _book_ in which for the first time is published an
essay, a story, a poem, or what not by one particular writer ranks as a
first edition of that writer. Naturally, however, complete works take
precedence over partial works, and I have grouped at the end of each
section of this book such partial or minor first editions as I have been
able to identify.

It must be clearly understood that first _magazine_ publication is not
here referred to. The only periodical issue of a book that can rank with
book issue is that in _parts_, according to which the text of a novel
made its appearance in monthly or weekly sections, separately wrappered,
under its own title and unaccompanied by any extraneous matter save
advertisements. Part issues are essential to a collector; on the other
hand, the numbers of magazines in which this story or that made serial
appearance may be ignored. In many cases I have stated where (if
anywhere) novels were serialized, but such information is of general
rather than of collecting interest, save to those whose catholicity of
taste and house-room permit them the luxury of adding sets of magazines
to those of actual books.

(iii) The terms used to-day to describe sizes in uncut books vary from
those of an earlier period. For example, the terms “Post 8vo” and “12mo”
are now rarely met with, whereas prior to 1880 they were in regular and
common currency. Fearing that the modern buyer or seller of books would
be puzzled by too frequent an encounter with technicalities virtually
obsolete, I have expressed book sizes in terms familiar to present-day
ears and as nearly equivalent to those replaced as makes no matter. The
“8vo” book of the fifties is the “Demy 8vo” of the nineteen-twenties;
“Post 8vo” has become “Extra Crown 8vo”; “12mo” has become “Foolscap
8vo.” The phraseology adopted, being familiar, will give an immediate
general idea of a book's dimensions; the measurement in inches, given in
brackets in all but a handful of cases, will supply to an eighth of an
inch any further detail required.

(iv) The half-title is something of a bugbear to the collector of
Victorians. Its absence may be fatal; its presence may give pause. As
the nineteenth century progressed, methods of bookmaking became
standardized; but during the first fifty years publishers printed to
paper and their own convenience, regardless of uniformity even between
volumes of the same work. For this reason no certainty exists as to the
possession by any book of a half-title. Usually examination will show
whether, in a book lacking a half-title, the first sheet should rightly
provide one or no. The publisher who found his preliminary matter
adequate, without half-title, for four or eight pages, let it go at
that; if, however, he had two pages of his four or eight to spare, he
used them for half-title and verso. Wherever in the notes that follow I
have satisfied myself that an absence of half-title is correct, I have
drawn attention to that absence; wherever nothing is said, the silence
should be taken to signify that in perfect copies half-titles must
appear.

(v) In the matter of binding it was the custom from about 1830 to 1850
to issue many books both in cloth and in paper boards. The old fashion
for boards and labels died hard, and doubtless the trade found it paid
to humour at once the enthusiast for the new cloth and the conservative
lover of ancient ways. The collector who has the choice of a book either
in cloth or in boards (with which must be understood boards,
half-cloth[1]) and lacks either inclination or money to buy the two
should, if condition be equally good, buy the copy in boards. Such a
copy _may be_ of earlier but _cannot_ be of later issue than one in
cloth. Should the book be one of which the two styles were issued
simultaneously the copies will rank equally, although even in such cases
a board copy is preferable, seeing that probably fewer were published
than of those in cloth, and certainly fewer have survived.

Footnote 1:

  For convenience' sake the word “cloth” is used throughout these
  bibliographies to signify woven material used in binding. Technically,
  in the transition period between bound books and those fully bound,
  half-binding was carried out in “canvas,” cloth proper being of
  somewhat later date.

The phrase “boards (half-cloth) paper labels” is used in these
bibliographies to describe books which may be found _both_ in full-board
_and_ half-cloth styles. The colours of board and canvas vary greatly,
as different tones were often used for books belonging to one edition.

(vi) It will be noticed that in the majority of cases I give the _month_
as well as the year of a novel's publication. This, had it been
possible, I would wish to have supplied throughout, for by its help
alone can the vexed question of dated catalogues be properly determined.
Unfortunately, with the disappearance _in toto_ of many publishing
firms, the absorption of others under new names, and the surprising lack
of any complete files of lists and catalogues for the decades in
question, it has been impossible in every case to fix the dates thus
accurately. In determining the various issues of a first edition (for a
publisher does not bind his whole printing at once, but in lots as
required, and often at intervals of years), the date, if any, of the
catalogues of publications generally bound at the end of Victorian
novels is an essential factor. Where I give the month of publication in
the pages that follow, there can be no difficulty in detecting copies
bound up and issued after first publication. Elsewhere buyers can only
be advised to compare the date of title-page with that of catalogue. If
the latter predates or tallies with the former all _may_ be well; if the
catalogue date be later, the book is not a first issue, although still,
so far as the sheets are concerned, a copy of the first edition. In a
few rare cases, where numerous catalogues were printed during the same
year, the earliest date found in any particular first edition of that
year can be established only by experience. It is for this reason that
identity of year between title-page and catalogue _may_ rather than
_must_ indicate a true first issue.

(vii) Advice as to condition is easily given.

Never buy a rebound book or one of which the edges have been shaved.[2]

Footnote 2:

  In this, as always, generalization fails. The vast majority of the
  books here listed were first issued _uncut_; there are, however, a
  few—and those among the books of later date—that were published cut.
  The collector can identify these, if in original binding, by comparing
  measurement with that here given.

Be wary of books in cloth which bear no publisher's imprint on the
spine; a few are right, but the majority are remainder-bound. Only in
the very early days of cloth binding were spines unimprinted. Of course
_labelled_ books, whether in boards or half-cloth, never show
publishers' imprint at the tail of their spines.

Always examine end-papers. The quality of Victorian end-papers cannot be
obtained to-day, and it is rare that the substitution in one book of an
old end-paper from another is so neatly done as to defy detection.

Library labels and their horrid traces have no place in a fine copy. If,
however, a buyer inclines to accept ex-library copies pending better
fortune, he should prefer those marked _inside_ front covers to those of
which the actual cloth is disfigured. Should the choice be between a
copy in disfigured cloth and one of which the cloth is clean but the
end-papers renewed to obliterate some previous damage, the wise buyer
will take the first and leave the second. Better a dirty original than a
book neat but doctored.

Do not reject an otherwise good copy of a book because the case is loose
or the back-stitching perished. Such deterioration is easily and
painlessly repaired.

In the case of books illustrated with etchings or steel engravings,
compare the date often to be found on the plates with that on the
title-page. These dates should tally, or, if they do not, thought or
examination of prefatory matter should show the reason why.

Several cases exist of books reissued more than once, but without
printed indication of reissue, in a style identical with that of the
first edition. In such cases the plates, more often than not, bear their
silent witness, and the careful buyer, momentarily uncertain of his
dates, is saved the purchase of a book he does not want.

(viii) The volumes listed which I have not myself seen and examined are
asterisked and thus expressly noted as catalogued without personal
investigation. As may be imagined, some of the obscurer works of the
authors dealt with are extremely rare, and all my seeking has failed to
discover some of them. In every other case personal handling has
preceded analysis, even although collation may already have existed in
published form.

(ix) In conclusion I would appeal to any reader of my book who can
emend, develop, or dispute the statements therein contained to send me
forthwith his criticisms and suggestions. To work of this kind can be no
finality. Freak copies, copies containing catalogues of earlier date,
copies in earlier varieties of binding—of such things is the sport of
bibliography composed. No individual can be sure that one particular
issue of any book is the earliest; comparative certainty comes only from
cooperation. Wherever possible I have compared several copies of the
same book, but this was by no means everywhere. Consequently to look
forward to revision and yet more revision is, in the circumstances, a
matter for hope rather than one for shame.




                            ACKNOWLEDGMENTS


Perhaps the most pleasant element in the compiling of this book has been
the generosity and enthusiasm with which persons able to help have
responded to inquiries.

Among those who have contributed of their private knowledge facts that
but for them I could never have discovered, Mr. Richard Bentley must
have first place. Unique as an authority on Victorian publishing, Mr.
Bentley not only replied promptly and in detail to my importunate
inquiries, but made suggestions and gave information—often at
considerable personal trouble—which have greatly extended the scope and
utility of my book.

Other publishers and editors were no less ready to give me access to
such records of the past as were still in their keeping. To Mr. Arthur
Waugh (of Messrs. Chapman and Hall), to Mr. Kelk and to Mr. Barnard (of
Messrs. Longmans, Green), to Mr. Spalding (of Messrs. Chatto and
Windus), to Mr. Herbert Virtue (of Messrs. Virtue and Co.), to Mr.
Farquharson and to Mr. Leonard Huxley (of Messrs. John Murray), to Mr.
Marston (of the “Publishers' Circular”), I tender my best thanks.

Gratitude must next be expressed to booksellers and owners of books
whose contribution differed in kind but not in degree from that of the
foregoing. Mr. Walter Spencer put his unrivalled stock of Victorian
first editions wholly at my disposal, thus enabling me to examine many
rare items not elsewhere discoverable. He also lent me a series of
autograph letters from which certain details were obtainable. To Messrs.
Bain and Messrs. Maggs I owe opportunities of seeing books necessary to
my list. Mr. Hugh Walpole gave me access to his private collection, and
Mr. Cecil Davis, Mr. J. A. Green, and Mr. Clement Shorter helped to a
clearer understanding of the bibliography of Captain Marryat and of Mrs.
Gaskell.

Further, I should like to set down my appreciation of the facilities
afforded to me by the authorities of the British Museum and of the
Bodleian Library. Their willingness to shorten in my favour the tedious
process of extracting scattered volumes from their stores and vaults
saved much fatigue and hours of valuable time.

To my mother, to my wife, and to one of my publishers I owe thanks for
friendly collaboration at points where two heads and four hands had more
than twice the value of half their number. Lastly, and perhaps mostly, I
am indebted, for secretarial assistance and for help in the labour of
research, to Miss Martha Smith, whose accuracy and devotion have halved
my personal toil.




                            ANTHONY TROLLOPE
                               1815-1882




                          ANTHONY TROLLOPE[3]


Trollope's novels, like those of Jane Austen, are of the very essence of
fiction. Whatever they may lack in verbal subtlety, in passion, in
tragedy or in comedy of idea, they never lack that spiritual skeleton
without which no structure of a story-teller's imagining can survive.
Palaces more delicate, more romantic, more brilliant and more terrible
than those of Trollope have been erected and have stood to win the
admiration of posterity; but their splendour and their beauty are due
more to the solid material that upholds their walls and roofs than to
the skill and fancy of their decoration. Other palaces, because they
lacked such invisible but vital solidity, have drawn for an hour the
fickle favour of the crowd and then toppled into dust. It is easy, in
fiction, to create a nine days' wonder, but hard indeed to win the
esteem of ninety years.

Footnote 3:

  For his consent to the reprinting of this Essay I am grateful to the
  Editor of the “Nineteenth Century and After.”

Trollope has achieved that victory. Oblivion can now never be his, for
he has lived his bad times and survived. As must any artist worth the
name, he suffered eclipse—temporary, indeed, but so severe as at one
time to threaten permanence. He was scorned as dowdy and parochial by
the brilliant metropolitans of a succeeding generation. Only in the
hearts of quiet folk and among readers uninstructed in the genius of
their own time were his books remembered and cherished.

Until, slowly and slowly, opinion has begun to change. Quality has
outstayed vogue, and the latter comes smirking back to the smiles of a
lover yesterday despised. Indeed, Trollope is in a fair way to become
once again the fashion. For a while he will be honoured by the
enthusiasm of the intellectuals. Then, when they have turned their
volatile benevolence to some other quarter, he will settle firmly in the
respect of the critical. And that will at once be fame and his deserts.

Any summary analysis of Trollope's individual novels is wellnigh
impossible, in view not only of the bulk of his work but also of its
scope and richness of content. His quality is more intangible and at the
same time more concentrated than that of the other writers treated in
this book. “Of all the needs a book has, the chief need is that it be
readable,” wrote Trollope himself. And again: “The primary object of a
novelist is to please.” Readability has, in these latter days, become a
term of condescension. But that is the fault of a superior age, and for
the ten who use the word contemptuously there are ten thousand who, did
they care to do so, would give it an older and a more honourable
meaning. To them, as always to the large public of novel-readers,
fiction, when it is not costume-romance, mystery-story, or topical
propaganda, is a revelation of their own lives. It is this demand for an
expression of emotions in which the normal reader can share that
Trollope so amazingly satisfies. No précis of plot, no indication of
social setting, of character types, nor of period, can in his case
convey the essence of any particular novel.

Nevertheless his stories fall into certain specific categories, some of
which form actual series of tales with characters reappearing from
volume to volume, while others, although severally independent and
self-contained, may be classified as belonging to one type of fiction or
to another.

The best known group of novels is that dealing with the society of the
city of Barchester and of the surrounding neighbourhood. _The Chronicles
of Barsetshire_, as they have been called, are six in number:

                THE WARDEN (1855),
                BARCHESTER TOWERS (1857),
                DOCTOR THORNE (1858),
                FRAMLEY PARSONAGE (1861),
                THE SMALL HOUSE AT ALLINGTON (1864), and
                THE LAST CHRONICLE OF BARSET (1867).

Although these famous stories undoubtedly contain much of Trollope's
best work, they do not contain the whole of it. It is a mistake to
suppose that they rank altogether higher than his other books, and one
of the most disastrous results of the disfavour into which his novels
fell after their author's death is that a wealth of really first-rate
material, just because it is included in books of which the late
eighties chose to forget the titles, lies hidden to-day and withdrawn
from the enjoyment of modern readers.

Cases of such unmerited neglect are encountered immediately and among
the novels of Trollope's second continuous and interconnected series.
The “political” stories, like those of Barsetshire, are six in number:

                     CAN YOU FORGIVE HER? (1864),
                     PHINEAS FINN (1869),
                     THE EUSTACE DIAMONDS (1873),
                     PHINEAS REDUX (1874),
                     THE PRIME MINISTER (1876), and
                     THE DUKE'S CHILDREN (1880).

It is truly remarkable to what an extent these admirable tales have
fallen into oblivion. Not only do they introduce many of Trollope's most
masterly characters, but they present, vividly and with knowledge, the
minds and manners of the political aristocracy, the social hangers-on,
the Tadpoles and Tapers of the day. Speaking generally, the social
setting of the political novels is different from that of _The
Chronicles of Barsetshire_. Indeed, it could hardly be otherwise, seeing
that the whole series takes its tone from the personalities of
Plantagenet Palliser and his wife Lady Glencora, who, as the stories
progress and by natural course of inheritance, become the Duke and
Duchess of Omnium and the greatest of English nobility. Trollope's
method is not slavishly to serialize the life story of any individual
character or pair of characters. All the political novels have their own
clearly defined plot. They are, however, all tinged with the compelling
personalities of Lady Glencora and her husband, into which Trollope
threw all that he had of art and enthusiasm.

_Can You Forgive Her?_ is a long novel, concerned primarily with the
troubles of a motherless girl who breaks an engagement with an
oppressively upright man in order to return to a youthful love affair
with a dissipated and unscrupulous cousin. Mr. Grey, the honourable man,
gets in the end the wife he wants; but Trollope does not hesitate to
show fairly the preference of a high-spirited girl for an adventurous
rascal, and there will be many who, when the book is finished, will
regret—a little ashamedly—that virtue has ultimately triumphed. In the
life story of Lady Glencora _Can You Forgive Her?_ is important, for it
pictures her newly married and literally on the verge of running away
from her shy, proud, inarticulate husband, with a beautiful young
reprobate, whose previous intimacy with her the reader may imagine at
his discretion. The fallibility of Lady Glencora is skilfully contrasted
with that of Alice Vavasor, the heroine of the book; their circumstances
are so similar, and yet the young women react to them so differently!

_Phineas Finn_ is a tale of political ambition. The hero, by whose name
the book is called, is a poor Irishman who comes to seek his fortune in
Parliament. The ups and downs of his career; Lady Laura Kennedy, who
loves him but from family pressure marries millions; Madame Max Goesler,
the fascinating, mysterious widow who rejects flattering if dubious
proposals from the old Duke of Omnium, combine with a mass of other
material to make a really dramatic story that is continued, and equally
well continued, in _Phineas Redux_.

Not the least remarkable feature of the second of these two books is the
hero's trial for murder. Trollope has a genius for trial scenes, and to
my mind it is an open question whether that in _Phineas Redux_ is not
finer than its more celebrated predecessors in _The Three Clerks_ and in
_Orley Farm_.

_The Eustace Diamonds_ turns on the personality of Lizzie Eustace, a
selfish but attractive little woman who keeps possession, in the teeth
of lawyers and of her late husband's relations, of certain priceless
jewels to which she has no right whatever. There are two or three
subplots in the story, all of good quality; but the character of Lizzie
Eustace, who, for all her lying and her insincerity and her cheap
smartness, is seductive and appealing, stands out as the book's
essential achievement.

_The Prime Minister_ and _The Duke's Children_ are the only two novels
of the political series in which Plantagenet Palliser, now Duke of
Omnium, is admittedly the central figure. The former book is so
constructed as to give prominence to the love affair and unhappy
marriage of Emily Wharton with Ferdinand Lopez, a stock gambler and
commercial adventurer. But although the history of the Lopez ménage is
admirably told, and gives scope for the reintroduction of Lizzie
Eustace, as well as other strange and disreputable people, the story of
the first premiership of the Duke of Omnium is the real story of the
book. By the time he came to the writing of _The Prime Minister_,
Trollope had become deeply interested in presenting in the person of the
Duke his ideal conception of an English aristocrat. No praise can be too
high for the skill with which he implies, but does not describe, the
divergent qualities of ambition possessed by the Duke and by his wife.
Throughout the book she is for ever striving to make him in the eye of
the world the greatest gentleman of the greatest kingdom of all time.
He, on the other hand, sees in his position only duty and responsibility
and disappointment. Not the least of his troubles are his wife's
insistence that the life of a public man is never private, and her
expressed conviction that give and take is the essence of political
compromise and therefore of premiership.

In the interval between _The Prime Minister_ and _The Duke's Children_
the Duchess of Omnium dies. The unhappy Duke is left to find, if he may,
in the achievements of his children that completeness and success to
secure which he feels that he has himself so utterly failed. Everything
goes awry. His only daughter gives her love to an unknown and penniless
commoner. His younger son, after ragging through his university career,
resorts disastrously to cards and racing. Finally, his heir—Lord
Silverbridge—stands for Parliament in the opposite interest to that of
his father, and, worse still, turns from the girl the Duke has chosen as
his bride, in order to throw his title and prospects at the feet of the
beautiful daughter of an American savant. The Duke struggles against his
own humanity; slowly and unhappily, as is his way, he adjusts himself to
the changing times; at the last he sacrifices his ideals of nobility to
personal affection. _The Duke's Children_ worthily closes a series of
fine novels. In some ways this last story of the political group is the
best, and it speaks a good deal for the author's power of sustained
imagination that he contrived, over a period of sixteen years, to
maintain the interest and develop the vitality of so complex a
collection of characters.

The rough classifications of novels in themselves independent may, out
of respect for chronology, begin with the stories of Irish life. _The
Macdermotts of Ballycloran_ (1847), _The Kellys and the O'Kellys_
(1848), _Castle Richmond_ (1860) and _The Landleaguers_ (1883), are the
four books which belong, properly speaking, to this category. Of course
there are Irish scenes in many other novels, for Trollope lived for
years in Ireland, knew it well and loved it, and was for ever
introducing Irishmen and Irish incidents into his work. The books above
mentioned are, however, wholly and deliberately novels about Ireland.
The first two have the faults of very early work, in that they are
prolix and lack that control of character and material that marks the
experienced novelist. Both, however, are worth reading, and the plot of
_The Kellys_ needs no excuse on the score of inexperience. _Castle
Richmond_, however, is definitely an unsuccessful book. It is packed
with information about the Irish famine, and the story is
over-melodramatic for Trollope's method. One of his most characteristic
qualities as a novelist is his refusal to keep the reader in suspense.
In direct contrast to Wilkie Collins, he goes out of his way to explain,
as he comes to it, each seemingly inexplicable event. It is as though he
scorns to save himself the trouble of characterization by erecting
between himself and the reader a screen of mystery. For this reason, the
secret power exercised by the unsavoury Molletts over Sir Thomas
Fitzgerald is, because it soon ceases to be secret, a weak foundation
upon which to erect a story. _The Landleaguers_, the book left
unfinished by Trollope when he died, is concerned to present the social
condition of Ireland in the early eighties, as was _Castle Richmond_ to
depict that of the famine-ridden forties. And yet what a difference! In
_The Landleaguers_ the novelist presents his picture of politics in his
actual story. There are no passages of blue-book instructionalism, but
it is doubtful whether a more vivid impression of the state of Ireland
at the time can be obtained from any other source. Even if there were no
others among Trollope's old-age novels to disprove the theory, _The
Landleaguers_ alone should put an end to the contention that toward the
end of his life he had lost his cunning or written himself out.

                  *       *       *       *       *

It is now necessary to examine that large and heterogeneous collection
of novels which, from one point of view or another, satirize
contemporary life or present some definite aspect of the English social
scene. Let me once more insist that the classification of Trollope's
books here attempted should not be understood too literally. All the
Barchester novels, all the political novels, are in one sense wholly
presentments of society; in the same way many of them contain passages
definitely satirical. But they have other claims to special grouping
which the numerous isolated stories now to be considered do not possess;
and, while satire is mainly incidental to the tales of Barchester and to
those of political life, it is in some at least of Trollope's other
books the principal purpose of the story.

First, then, the books which may fairly be termed books of social
satire. The earliest in date is _The Bertrams_, which, although the
situations and characters are of the kind which Trollope was to make
essentially his own, is a failure even more complete than _Castle
Richmond_. The central theme is one to which the author more than once
returns. Caroline Waddington rejects George Bertram for reasons of
income and prospects. She marries his successful lawyer friend, only to
find that she has sold herself to a greedy tyrant. The parallel case of
Julia Brabazon and Harry Clavering immediately suggests itself; but
where in _The Claverings_ Trollope achieves an intense humanity, in _The
Bertrams_ he is dully mechanical. He allows the subsidiary plots to
disturb and obscure his main story. When, as frequently, he attempts the
comic in social enjoyment he comes clumsily to grief. The widow's
seaside picnic in _Can you Forgive Her?_ has only to be contrasted with
the excursion from Jerusalem described in _The Bertrams_ to make clear
the difference between successful and unsuccessful satire. And yet there
are points in _The Bertrams_. The close-fisted old man, the disposal of
whose money provides the motive of most of the incident, is drawn with
consistent restraint. There are touches in the description of society at
Littlebath that prepare the reader for the pleasure of _Miss Mackenzie_.
On the whole the book should be read. It is Trollope “off” (or rather
“not yet on to”) his game, but it was published at an important moment
in his career and helps to make clear his subsequent development.

_Rachel Ray_ (1863) and _Miss Mackenzie_ (1865) may, without any
critical licence, be considered together. Both are bitter satires on
Evangelical Christianity. Trollope inherited from his mother a hatred of
the brimstone school of religious teachers, and in these novels he lets
himself go with considerable effect. The earlier of the two books
contains comparatively few characters, and those of modest social
position. Rachel herself is delightful and gives to the book, despite
its obvious weaknesses of construction, a freshness and charm that is
very pleasing. Mrs. Prime and her horrible clerical admirer are frankly
caricature, but that they should be so is not unnatural, seeing that
they represent the very puritanism that the book is intended to attack.

In _Miss Mackenzie_ we are given the story of a spinster of thirty-five,
to whom unexpectedly a small fortune is bequeathed. She becomes
immediately the quarry of fortune hunters—shabby social, religious, and
commercial. Some of the best scenes in the story are staged in
Littlebath, where Miss Todd and Miss Baker (who help to retrieve _The
Bertrams_ from disaster) make welcome reappearance. As satire the novel
is more dexterous than _Rachel Ray_, but it lacks the attraction of a
real Trollope heroine, and throughout has a faint tinge of the sordid.
It is interesting to note on page 242 of the second volume a mention of
Lady Glencora Palliser, whom Trollope had 'presented' in _Can you
Forgive Her?_

Not until 1875 did Trollope publish another definitely satirical novel.
When he did so, the event marked an important stage in his evolution as
a novelist. Critics had begun to grumble at comedies of manners, which
spoke of the suavity of yesterday rather than of the competitive hustle
of to-day. England was moving step by step along the road to
commercialism. Trollope, with his county and clerical families, his
political aristocrats and comic tuft-hunters, was shrugged aside as out
of date. Such treatment was intolerable, and, with a gesture half
impatient, half appealing, he sent out into the world _The Way We Live
Now_. This long and crowded novel—perhaps, with the exception of _The
Last Chronicle of Barset_, the most abundant of all his books—presents,
in the person of Mr. Melmotte, the financial magnate of alien origin
proper to a truly modern story of English life. Whether the cavillers,
whose complaints spurred Trollope to so violent an effort, admitted,
after reading _The Way We Live Now_, that the old dog could in truth
out-modern the best of them, history does not relate; but undeniably
this book, in which he asserted his vitality and showed that in the
matter of satiric observation he was well abreast of the times, has no
lack of vigour or luxuriant invention.

That _Mr. Scarborough's Family_ (1883) may reasonably be said to
conclude the list of Trollope's satirical novels is perhaps disputable.
And yet, because its power is mainly ironic, I prefer to mention it here
rather than treat of it as a purely social story. A while ago one
example was quoted of a first-rate book from Trollope's last period.
_Mr. Scarborough's Family_ is another.

An aged and wealthy cynic suddenly (and, as it turns out, with
deliberate falsehood) makes public the illegitimacy of his eldest son.
With the complications of inheritance, with the changing relations
between old Mr. Scarborough and his two sons, of whom the elder is now
destitute and the latter coldly triumphant in his unexpected good
fortune, is involved an elaborate second plot, centring round the love
story of an amiable young man, whose fortunes depend on the favour of a
peevish and eccentric uncle. Analysis of a tale so full of happening and
character is impossible in a few lines. Sufficient to say that _Mr.
Scarborough's Family_, were it not for the date on its title-page, might
be thought to belong to a much earlier period, not only of Trollope, but
of fiction as a whole, to a period more lavish than subtle, more genial
and full-blooded than detached and sensitive.

With _The Three Clerks_ (1858) opens the chronology of those novels
which, although partially satirical, are in the main straightforward
stories of English cultivated life. _The Three Clerks_ is one of the few
Trollope novels that has been seriously overrated. In its pages Mr.
Chaffanbrass, the notorious Old Bailey lawyer, makes his first
appearance, but he is infinitely more effective in _Orley Farm_ and in
_Phineas Finn_ than at his first entrance on the Trollope stage. In so
far as _The_ _Three Clerks_ gives a picture of the Civil Service that
the author himself knew, it has documentary value, but as fiction it is
formless and flaccid. Its young women are wholly devoid of that
freshness and frankness that place Trollope, as a creator of femininity,
apart from all other novelists of his generation; its menfolk are either
riotous dummies like those in Smedley's novels, or prigs and villains,
compounded so slavishly by recipe as to have little meaning beyond that
of the conventional types they represent.

Of _Orley Farm_ (1862) it is unnecessary to speak, the novel being one
of the two or three outside the Barchester series which are still read
to-day. _The Belton Estate_ (1866), on the other hand, badly needs
rehabilitation. Henry James, in a review written when quite a young man,
concluded a long paragraph of hostile criticism with the words: “_The
Belton Estate_ is a stupid book.” One may venture that the obtuseness
was not all on one side. Using a cast of four principal and as few
subsidiary characters, Trollope fills three good volumes with the
matrimonial dilemma of Clara Amedroz, who has to choose between the
uncouth, well-to-do farmer to whom passes her thriftless father's
estate, and the polished, self-seeking Captain Aylmer—in parlance,
though not in fact, also her cousin—who offers her marriage because at
the deathbed of his rich aunt and as part condition of becoming her heir
he swore to do so. _The Belton Estate_ has, to a greater degree than any
other of Trollope's books, that art of concealing art which delights one
type of mind, but by another is dismissed as “stupid.” In a sense it is
the most difficult to appreciate of all the important novels, and, were
an examination in Trollope a thing of practical import, the examining
board would be wise to make this book the test question of their paper.

_The Claverings_ (1867) and _He Knew He Was Right_ (1869) are very long
books, each of which turns on a theme highly characteristic of the
author. Mention has already been made of Julia Brabazon, heroine of the
former book, who jilts the nobody she loves for a rich invalid peer. The
price she has to pay is counted in full in the pages of _The
Claverings_, which also introduce a number of excellent characters, from
Sir Hugh Clavering, hard, savage, and selfish, to Sophie Gordeloup and
her scoundrelly brother, who play so desperately for the wealth and
person of Lord Ongar's lonely and embittered widow. _He Knew He Was
Right_ describes the steady growth in a husband's mind of unjust
suspicion of his wife's fidelity. As a crescendo of hysterical mistrust,
the book is a fine piece of sustained writing. As a novel, it would be
gloomy and distressing but for an admirable and humorous by-plot laid in
cathedral Exeter. It would, perhaps, be hypercritical and unappreciative
of his adroit handling of incident to blame the author for the very
liberal use of coincidence with which he aids the progress of his story.

Of the six social novels that remain, one is first-rate, three are very
good second-rate, one is ordinary second-rate and the last frankly bad.
_Is He Popenjoy?_ (1878) may rank with _The Claverings_ as a book
undeservedly excluded from the upper room of every Trollope-lover's
mind. The Dean of Brotherton, son of a jobmaster, father of the heroine
and ultimately grandfather of a marquis, is a Trollope dignitary of the
first water. His daughter is as eminent in the world of heroines as is
her father in that of ecclesiastics. She is gay, loving, whimsical,
courageous, and always natural. Her dour husband with his excessive
sense of duty and inadequate sense of humour; her aristocratic
sisters-in-law, shrouding in ill-nature and good works the emptiness of
their lives and purses; the society siren; the society matchmaker; and
perhaps above all the ill-tempered, dissolute marquis, on the legitimacy
of whose son turns the whole mechanism of the story, are each one of
them fictional characters that only a master could create.

_Ralph The Heir_ (1871)—the plot of which was pirated by Charles Reade
and dramatized under the title _Shilly Shally_—contains some good
characters and perhaps the best parliamentary election of all those
contrived by its author. The troubles and difficulties of the shy,
ineffective Sir Thomas Underwood, and the determination of Mr. Neefit,
the breeches-maker, to buy up a bankrupt young squire as husband for his
daughter would give distinction to any story. _Lady Anna_ (1874) is a
delicate elaboration of Trollope's favourite motif—projected or (as in
this case) actual misalliance. _The American Senator_ (1877) contains
some excellent hunting and much good general observation. _Ayala's
Angel_ (1881), like _The Belton Estate_ but less pronouncedly, is a book
that must be read to be realized, for it is quiet Trollope and a thing
of shades rather than one of definite, contrasted colours.

There remains _Marion Fay_ (1882), once again a tale of misalliance.
This is undeniably the worst book that its author ever wrote. Everywhere
but here he contrives to keep either his hero or his heroine (and more
frequently both) sympathetic, sensible, and convincingly normal; but in
_Marion Fay_ he sinks to mawkishness and to a deathbed scene that is
frankly inexcusable.

                  *       *       *       *       *

Plenty of novels still remain of this astonishing and untiring writer.
They may, however, be somewhat summarily dismissed. The most interesting
group is that of the short, single-theme stories which succeeded the
publication of _The Way We Live Now_. It is not unreasonable to
attribute to the mood of challenge in which that novel was sent out the
noticeable change in the author's method during the years that followed.
It is as though he had determined to try his hand at the psychological
analysis which was just coming into fashion among novelists. And so we
are given in quick succession six little books, each written round a
single event or describing the reactions of one individual to a definite
set of circumstances. The titles are as follow:

                     AN EYE FOR AN EYE (1879),
                     COUSIN HENRY (1879),
                     DOCTOR WORTLE'S SCHOOL (1881),
                     THE FIXED PERIOD (1882),
                     KEPT IN THE DARK (1882),
                     AN OLD MAN'S LOVE (1884).

It so happened that _An Eye for An Eye_ was written before the
publication of _The Way We Live Now_, although not published until some
while after. It is, however, clearly the product (if an unconscious one)
of the same impulse as gave birth to the other books, and its theme—the
struggle in the mind of a young Englishman between pride of family and
desire to fulfil a marriage promise to a girl who has become his
mistress—is a theme of the type peculiar to these six brief stories and
distinctly foreign to Trollope's more bulky and eventful work.

A further group of five stories may roughly be termed Trollope's
“oversea” novels. The first three—_Nina Balatka_ (1867), _Linda Tressel_
(1868), and _The Golden Lion of Granpere_ (1872)—were written more or
less intentionally to form a distinct trio. They are semi-romantic
tales, staged respectively in old Prague, in old Nürnberg, and among the
Vosges mountains; pleasant enough, but quite definitely of minor
importance. The first two were published anonymously but achieved little
success, and were later reissued over the author's name. _Harry
Heathcote of Gangoil_ (1874) and _John Caldigate_ (1879) are novels of
Australia, based on the knowledge of that continent which the author
gained when visiting one of his sons who had established himself there.
I understand that as pictures of Australian life they are vivid and
reliable. Be that as it may, the untutored reader, seeking only for
Trollope, will find him abundantly in _Harry Heathcote_, which is an
eventful, almost an adventurous story, and to a very satisfying degree
in the longer book that appeared five years later.

Of Trollope's various volumes of short stories nothing need here be
said. Of _Sir Harry Hotspur of Humblethwaite_ (1871) there is little
that can be said. Of _The Struggles of Brown, Jones, and Robinson_
(1870) there is much that had better be left unsaid. One important
full-length novel remains, good in itself and at the same time
remarkable as the only one of the author's tales in which he arms
himself formally as a social crusader.

_The Vicar of Bullhampton_ (1870) is a novel written in defence of the
“fallen woman.” It is quaint to read Trollope's solemn and tactful
preface, in which he almost apologizes to his public for venturing on
such indelicate ground. Fortunately the book is so feeble as propaganda
that, but for the preface, one would be unaware that it was written with
any special purpose. It can be enjoyed as a good story of village life,
with a delightful parson as central figure and the necessary complement
of charming Trollope ladies, gruff farmers, lonely landowners, and
aggressive Nonconformity.

This novel, like all Trollope's really good work, impresses the reader
first and foremost with its Englishry. Perhaps it would not be too much
to say that the very greatness of the author himself springs from this
same quality. He is intensely English, with the quiet humour, the shy
sympathy masquerading as indifference, the delicate sense of kindliness
and toleration, the occasional heaviness, the occasional irritability,
that mark a man or a book as English. But if to these qualities he owes
his place in our proud heritage of literature, to them also he owes the
tarrying of due recognition, for they and the natures that possess them
are of all qualities and of all natures the most difficult to impress
upon the sceptical outsider, seeing that their very beauty and
preciousness and power lie in their elusiveness.

  ANTHONY TROLLOPE: HIS WORK, ASSOCIATES AND LITERARY ORIGINALS. By T.
    H. S. ESCOTT. London: John Lane, 1913.

This book will be of interest to the general reader, although it is
rather overloaded with analyses of novel-plots and the arrangement is
not ideal.

By far the most valuable feature of the volume is the bibliography of
Trollope by Margaret Lavington included at the end. For the help this
careful and documented compilation has given me I wish to make
acknowledgment, although I have throughout worked independently and from
original sources and taken none of the facts hereafter given without
verification. Miss Lavington's descriptions lack certain details
essential to the collector, she makes one or two actual mistakes, but,
within the limits she has laid down for herself, her work is wonderfully
complete and accurate.

      during the first eighteen months of publication. The balance
      of 400 was bound, very nearly uniform with the first issue,

      catalogue bound in at the end of Vol. I.

                                  1865

  MISS MACKENZIE. By ANTHONY TROLLOPE. London: Chapman and Hall, 193
    Piccadilly. 1865. Ex. Cr. 8vo (4¾ × 7¾).

    Vol. I. pp. vi + 312.

    Vol. II. pp. vi + 313 + (3). Advertisement of works by the same
    author occupies p. (315).

    Maroon cloth, gilt, blocked in blind. Yellow end-papers.

      NOTES—(i) This book was published in March, 1865.

      (ii) A binding of dark green cloth is more frequently seen
      than that of maroon, but it is fairly certain that the
      latter is really the first issue. I have come to this
      conclusion after a study of other publications, for binding
      which the two types of cloth used for _Miss Mackenzie_ were
      employed. Both are patterned cloths, but differently
      patterned. That used in maroon for _Miss Mackenzie_ was also
      used—differently coloured, of course—for Trollope's _Tales
      of All Countries_ (1861); Ainsworth's _Constable of the
      Tower_ (1861); Mrs. Gaskell's _Round the Sofa_ (1859) and
      _Right at Last_ (1860); Charles Allston Collins' _Cruise
      Upon Wheels_ (1862); and Reade's _Love me Little, Love me
      Long_ (1859). The pattern of cloth, on the other hand, used
      in dark green for _Miss Mackenzie_ reappears on Trollope's
      _Belton Estate_ (1866); Ainsworth's _John Law_ (1864); and
      Wilkie Collins' _My Miscellanies_ (1863). I think these
      facts provide sufficiently conclusive evidence that the
      maroon cloth is of an earlier pattern than the dark green.
      Publishers were probably inclined, then as now, to use one
      type of cloth more than another at certain given dates
      (possibly they tended to adopt novelties as produced by
      their binders). This is independently suggested by the fact
      that in the year 1863 alone an identical pattern of cloth
      was used and by various publishers for Ainsworth's _Cardinal
      Pole_, for Mrs. Gaskell's _A Dark Night's Work_, for George
      Eliot's _Romola_, and for Mrs. Oliphant's _Perpetual
      Curate_.

      NOTES—(i) Four weeks after the appearance of Part I. (early
      in November, 1869) a parallel series of two-shilling
      _monthly_ parts was inaugurated, of which the first,
      containing the first four weekly parts, was immediately
      issued, and the remainder at regular intervals. The earliest
      part issue was therefore the weekly one. Margaret Lavington
      in her Trollope bibliography, states that the first four
      parts were wrappered in one. This observation was probably
      made from an examination of a made-up set of parts composed,
      as to the first four, of the second issue and, as to the
      remainder, of the first (see above).

      (ii) The story appeared in two-volume form in May, 1869.

      NOTE—This is a dramatization of an episode in _The Last

      manager.

      NOTE—This book was published in November, 1870. The story
      had appeared serially in the “Cornhill” in the years 1861
      and 1862. Its unpopularity as a serial accounts for the
      delay in its book publication.


                                  1870

  THE COMMENTARIES OF CÆSAR. By ANTHONY TROLLOPE. William Blackwood and

      “Macmillan's Magazine.”


                                  1871

  RALPH THE HEIR. By ANTHONY TROLLOPE, author of _Framley Parsonage_,
    _Sir Harry Hotspur_ etc., etc. London: Hurst and Blackett,
    Publishers, 13 Great Marlborough Street. 1871. 3 vols. Cr. 8vo (4⅞ ×
    7⅜).

    Vol I. pp. (iv) + 342. Advertisement of _Sir Harry Hotspur_ occupies
    p. (ii) facing title.

    Vol. II. pp. (iv) + 338.

    Vol. III. pp. (iv) + 347 + (1).

    Publishers' advertisements, 16 pp., printed on text paper and paged,
    bound in at end. Brown cloth, gilt, blocked in black. Blue-black
    end-papers.

    This story originally appeared in parts, which were issued as
    supplements to “St. Paul's Magazine.” The instalments were paged
    continuously, but separately from the rest of the magazine.

    Parts I. to XI. were enclosed in fawn paper wrappers printed in
    black and red and dated January, 1870, to November, 1870. Parts XII.
    to XVIII. were not wrappered at all, but merely stitched in at the
    end of the numbers of the magazine with their own pagination. The
    series contained eleven full-page line-engraved illustrations by F.
    A. Fraser, the last of which appeared in Part XI.

    Apart from that printed on the back wrappers of Parts I. to XI., no
    advertisement material was included with the part issue. Title-page
    and contents (4 pp.) for the one-volume edition were supplied with
    the eighteenth and last instalment.

    Although the real first book edition of the novel (published in
    April, 1870) was in three volumes cr. 8vo. as described above, the
    type and illustrations of the “St. Paul's” issue were used in a
    one-volume demy 8vo (5⅝ × 7⅞) edition (pp. iv + 434—no half-title or
    list of illustrations) issued by Strahan and Co. in 1871, after the
    story's serial completion. This one-volume edition is bound in green
    cloth, gilt, blocked in blind, and has dark yellow or terra-cotta
    end-papers.

      NOTE—The three-volume edition was published on April 6,
      1871. I have failed to establish the exact publishing date
      of the one-volume edition, but it was in June or July of the
      same year. Oddly enough the later issue is rarer than the
      earlier, for the sheets were quickly taken over by Routledge
      and issued in a different binding in 1872.


                                  1872

  THE GOLDEN LION OF GRANPERE. By ANTHONY TROLLOPE, author of _Ralph the
    Heir_, _Can you Forgive Her?_ etc. London: Tinsley Bros., 18
    Catherine Street, Strand. 1872. 1 vol. Ex. Cr. 8vo (5⅛ × 7¾). Pp.
    (iv) + 353 + (9). Publishers' advertisements, paged 1 to 6 and dated
    May, 1872, occupy pp. 355 to 363. Red-brown cloth, gilt, blocked in
    black. Pale yellow end-papers.

      NOTES—(i) This book was published in May, 1872. The story
      appeared serially in “Good Words.” It had been written in
      1867 for “Blackwood's,” but had proved unacceptable.

      (ii) Copies are sometimes found in dark brown cloth,
      lettered and blocked less heavily and with lighter boards.
      These are probably later in issue.

    gilt, blocked in black. Dark green end-papers.

      NOTES—(i) This book was published in March, 1873.

      (ii) The text was later split up and issued in four small
      volumes, each dealing with a definite province or provinces
      of Australia and New Zealand. These little books have no
      importance as “editions,” for they contain no matter not
      include in the original two-volume issue.

      NOTES—(i) This book was published in October, 1874. The

      (ii) The sheets of this edition were, in the year of
      publication, cut down and issued in a volume measuring 4½ ×

      printed separately. This later issue is bound in green or in
      violet cloth, blocked in gold and black, and contains at the

    illustrations afterwards included in the two-volume edition. Each

      NOTE—The novel appeared in book form in July, 1875.


                    THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: PART ISSUE.

      The following advertisement pages, etc., should be

      which the last eight publishers' lists.

      _Parts II to VIII: Front_—4 pp. _Back_—Nil.

                                  1876

  THE PRIME MINISTER. By ANTHONY TROLLOPE. London: Chapman and Hall, 193

    Vol. IV. pp. (iv) [paged as vi] + 347 + (1).

    No half-titles. Red-brown cloth, gilt, blocked in black. Cream
    end-papers.

    This story originally appeared in eight cr. 8vo five-shilling parts,
    dated 1876 (no title-pages in Parts I., III., V., and VII.), bound
    in grey paper wrappers, printed in black. Part I. appeared in
    November, 1875, and subsequent numbers at intervals of one month.

      NOTES—(i) The novel was published in volume form in May,
      1876.

      (ii) Sets of the parts are sometimes met with, bound
      separately in red-brown cloth and lettered on spine only
      with the title of the book and the number of the part. I
      cannot establish the relative dates of the regular
      four-volume cloth issue and of the eight clothbound parts.


                    THE PRIME MINISTER: PART ISSUE.

      Apart from that printed on the wrappers, no advertisement
      material was included with the parts of this novel, save
      that at front of Part VI was inserted a 4 pp. leaflet (4 ×
      6⅜) of Chapman and Hall's Popular Two Shilling novels. Note
      should, however, be taken of the incidence of preliminary
      matter.

      _Part I_: (iv) + 1-162. The preliminary matter consists of:
      Section half-title, reading: PART I., Vol. I. Verso blank.
      Title, reading: _The Prime Minister_. By Anthony Trollope.
      London: Chapman and Hall, 193, Piccadilly. 1876. Verso
      blank. _No_ list of contents.

      _Part II_: (ii) + 163-337 + (1). Preliminary matter: Section
      half-title: PART II., Vol. I. Verso blank.

      _Part III_: (vi) [paged as iv] + 1-170. Preliminary matter
      consists of: Section half-title, reading: PART III., Vol.
      II. Verso blank. Title, as in Part I. Verso blank. Contents
      of Vol. II. (2 pp.).

      _Part IV_: (iv) + 171-342. Preliminary matter: 2 pp. blank.
      Section half-title: PART IV., Vol. II. Verso blank.

      _Part V_: vi + 1-174. Preliminary matter consists of:
      Section half-title, reading: PART V., Vol. III. Verso blank.
      Title, as in Parts I. and III. Verso blank. Contents of Vol.
      III. (2 pp.).

      _Part VI_: (iv) + 175-346. Preliminary matter: 2 pp. blank.
      Section half-title: PART VI. Verso blank.

      _Part VII_: vi + 1-168. Preliminary matter consists of:
      Section half-title reading: PART VII., Vol. IV. Verso blank.
      Title, as in Parts I., III., and V. Verso blank. Contents of
      Vol. IV. (2 pp.).

      _Part VIII_: (ii) + 169-347 + (1). Preliminary matter.
      Section half-title: PART VIII. Verso blank.

      It is evident, from a comparison between the foregoing
      details and the collation of the four-volume edition
      previously described, that the publishers were compelled, to
      complete the latter, to print a contents list to Vol. 1. and
      to add the words “In four volumes, Vol. 1.,” etc., to the
      title-pages. It will be seen that they had so mismanaged the
      pagination of the preliminary matter during part issue, that
      only one of the four final volumes was correctly paged
      throughout.

      slight differences of decorative blocking. Which style is
      the earlier I do not know.

      NOTES—(i) Copies of this book were also issued in two
      volumes, but with the same pagination and composed of the
      same sheets as the more usual one-volume issue. A new
      edition, with a frontispiece, was issued in November, 1882.

      (ii) In 1885, under the title _Thompson Hall_, the third
      story in this volume was issued separately by Messrs.
      Sampson Low. In some quarters the little book is regarded as
      a first edition and highly valued accordingly, but in truth
      it is not bibliographically an item of any importance, being
      a textual reprint of _Christmas at Thompson Hall_, under a
      slightly different title and with the addition of a few
      second-rate illustrations. For the benefit of those
      interested, the description and collation of the book is as
      follows:

    _Orley Farm_ etc. etc. With illustrations. London: Sampson Low,
    Marston, Searle and Rivington. Crown Buildings, 188 Fleet Street.

                                  1868

  BRITISH SPORTS AND PASTIMES 1868. Edited by ANTHONY TROLLOPE. London:
    Virtue and Co., 26 Ivy Lane. New York: Virtue and Yorston. 1868. 1
    vol. Ex. Cr. 8vo (4¾ × 7¾). Pp. (vi) + 322. Bright green embossed
    cloth, gilt, with title printed both on spine and side. Pale yellow
    end-papers.

      _Contents_: On Horse-Racing—On Hunting—On Shooting—On
      Fishing—On Yachting—On Rowing—On Alpine Climbing—On Cricket.
      Trollope was responsible for the preface (pp. 1-7) and the
      Essay “On Hunting” (pp. 70-129).

      NOTES—(i) This book was published in November, 1868. The
      contents had appeared in “St. Paul's Magazine.”

      (ii) The sheets of the first edition were later issued
      without change of date in a slightly different green
      binding, without the title in gold on the side, and bearing
      as imprint on spine, Daldy, Isbister and Co. The reissue was
      cut down to cr. 8vo, and the end-papers were chocolate
      instead of yellow.

      (iii) A still later issue of the book in its reduced format
      was bound in bright blue cloth, blocked in gold and black.
      This binding bears no imprint on spine, and was probably
      carried out by W. H. Smith and Son for a balance of edition
      purchased by them. George Eliot's novel _Felix Holt_ was
      treated in this way by Smiths some twelve years after
      publication, and the binding is very similar to that now
      under consideration.


                                 _NOTE_

It is stated by Margaret Lavington in her appendix to Escott's book that
Trollope “printed but never published” several of his lectures. I have
been unable to trace any privately printed lectures, but feel sure that
Trollope's first bibliographer would not speak of them as she does
without certain knowledge of their existence. The titles mentioned are:

             THE CIVIL SERVICE AS A PROFESSION,
             THE WAR IN AMERICA,
             ENGLISH PROSE FICTION AS A NATIONAL AMUSEMENT,
             THE HIGHER EDUCATION OF WOMEN.

No dates or other details are given.

From the same source I borrow a statement that a study of Thackeray by
Trollope, originally printed in the “Cornhill,” was republished as part
of Theodore Taylor's book _Thackeray: The Humourist and Man of Letters_,
which was issued in 1864. It is noticeable that Margaret Lavington
speaks of the publisher of this book as Appleton of New York. A book of
the same title by the same author was issued in the same year by Hotten
of Piccadilly, and it is a fair presumption that the volumes are
identical, but, although I have been carefully through the volume issued
by Hotten, I cannot identify any section as contributed by Trollope.




                           FREDERICK MARRYAT
                               1792-1849




                           FREDERICK MARRYAT


The reputation of Captain Marryat has suffered at the hands of time
somewhat differently from that of many of his contemporaries.
Superficially he has fared better than they, for, if little read except
by boys, he is at least acknowledged as a classic, and there are few
adult novel readers who could not from their own childhood gather
sufficient memories to characterize in summary some of his best known
books.

Nevertheless, it is arguable that the forgotten author is happier than
he who is accepted but unread. A revival of interest in the books of a
man not already docketed and filed in the appreciation of his age may
develop a new perspective. The body of his work may be exhumed and
permanently lodged in its proper niche of the catacombs of literature.
More hardly shall this befall such a one as Marryat, who is “placed”
already as a writer of sea stories for boys and as an instructor in
adventure for young people.

Who shall deny that he is all of this? His fame as a novelist of naval
escapade, of risk and makeshift among pirates and barbarians, is fame
deserved. The difficulty for one concerned to reappraise his work lies
in the fact that there is more to him than is here implied. He is the
only writer in the tradition of Fielding and Smollett who can claim
consideration on the same plane as these famous authors. That he is
overtopped by _Tom Jones_ no one will dispute, but that he ranks with
and not after Smollett is a contention that permits of argument.

The first result of an attempt to classify the books of Captain Marryat
is a realization that two of his finest works are—the one wholly, the
other mainly—unconcerned with ships or seafarers. _Japhet in Search of a
Father_ (1836) is a picturesque tale of vagabondage and social escapade.
_The Pacha of Many Tales_ (1835) is an adaptation of “The Arabian
Nights,” a series of narratives held together by a framework of Oriental
despotism.

_Japhet_ is partnered by two later novels—_Joseph Rushbrook; or, The
Poacher_ (1841) and _Valerie_ (1849). All three are land as opposed to
sea novels, and the first two show the fertile invention of the author,
his power of describing rogues and fashionable grotesques. But whereas
_Japhet_ is the best book Marryat ever wrote, _The Poacher_ is a little
weary, for it dates from the last period of the writer's life, when
ill-health and money troubles were pressing hardly on a man already
exhausted by a reckless youth; while _Valerie_, the autobiography of a
French girl cast on her own resources in Paris and in London, had better
have been left, as Marryat left it, a fragment cut short by sickness and
by death.

_The Pacha of Many Tales_ stands quite alone and stands proudly.
Marryat's humour is in this book congenial to the modern reader, while
of fantastic happening few works of fiction can show so rich a store. It
is hard to understand why this admirable parody of the “Thousand and One
Nights” is to-day so little read. Perhaps some enterprising publisher
will extract the story of Huckaback and issue it, grotesquely
illustrated. It should find its market.

The sea stories proper need little comment. They are eleven in number:

            THE NAVAL OFFICER; or, FRANK MILDMAY (1829),
            THE KING'S OWN (1830),
            NEWTON FORSTER; or, THE MERCHANT SERVICE (1832),
            PETER SIMPLE (1834),
            JACOB FAITHFUL (1834),
            MR. MIDSHIPMAN EASY (1836),
            THE PIRATE. THE THREE CUTTERS (1836),
            POOR JACK (1840),
            PERCIVAL KEENE (1842),
            THE PRIVATEER'S-MAN (1846).

The first of these titles is pure autobiography and, as the author
himself admitted, lacks most of the essentials of fiction. The story is
of the slightest and most perfunctory, the book being little more than
an account of Marryat's own early adventures at sea. David Hannay, in
his excellent little _Life of Marryat_, remarks acutely on the peculiar
meanness of the hero's character—a meanness that makes an even more
repellant appearance in the last but one of the sea stories—_Percival
Keene_. Seeing that Marryat was writing of himself and that the events
in the life of Frank Mildmay must have been easily recognizable by naval
contemporaries, it is remarkable that he should present his central
figure so unsympathetically, _unless he failed to realize the young
man's shortcomings_. Perhaps in part he saw his mistake, for in the five
novels that followed _The Naval Officer_ he offers the reader more
respectable but more colourless heroes. When the time came for writing
_Percival Keene_, either he had forgotten the warnings of twelve years
before or else he was tired of erecting dummy humanity to placate the
idealism of his readers.

The constructional weakness of _The Naval Officer_ Marryat took pains to
correct in his succeeding books. _Peter Simple_, _Jacob Faithful_ and
the rest may depend for their vitality and attraction on the excitements
encountered by their heroes while voyaging the seas or fighting in the
wars. Certainly the by-plots are unimportant and conventional. But the
author was careful in them all to give to the _course_ of the heroes'
adventures a real prominence and coherence, so that we read with an
anxiety to know what happens next and are not, as in _The Naval
Officer_, continually brought up by naval “shop” or invited to feel
indignant sympathy with the members of a noble but scurvily treated
service.

_The Pirate_ and _The Privateer's-Man_ are exciting tales of ocean
brigandage, the latter having in addition an antiquarian interest, for
the first portion of the story is based on the actual life-record of an
old time sea-rover. _Poor Jack_, although told in the first person and
comprising scenes on shipboard and adventurous happenings at sea of a
kind to suggest comparison with _Mr. Midshipman Easy_, has an historical
interest apart from its value as fiction, because it is an account of
Greenwich Hospital, in those days a retreat for wounded seamen.

Two groups remain among the stories of Frederick Marryat. _Snarleyow_
(1837) and _The Phantom Ship_ (1839) stand definitely apart from the
rest of the novels. Both tell of Dutch seafaring in the old days and
both introduce a strong element of the weird and the mysterious. That
Marryat should in these books have come under the influence of the
“terror” motive in fiction is surprising and interesting. After reading
_Japhet_ or _Mr. Midshipman Easy_ one would declare that nothing was
farther from the talent of their author than an excursion into the
“horrid.” And yet both _Snarleyow_ and _The Phantom Ship_ are excellent
books, which rank high among Marryat's novels for liveliness and for
characterization and, in addition, merit notice for their fearsomeness.
Of their value as historical documents I am unqualified to speak, but it
may be presumed that before writing them the author studied the lives
and methods of seventeenth and eighteenth century Dutch mariners, for
both books are circumstantially staged and show no desire to shirk
description of contemporary fact.

Of the stories written definitely for children the best known (and
rightly) is _Masterman Ready_ (1841-1842). It was followed by _The
Travels and Adventures of Monsieur Violet_ (1843); _The Settlers in
Canada_ (1844); _The Mission; or, Scenes in Africa_ (1845); _The
Children of the New Forest_ (1847); and _The Little Savage_ (1848-1849).

_Monsieur Violet_ is an improbable and tedious tale of Red Indians and
Mormons. The rest—with the exception of _The Children of the New
Forest_, which is a story of Cavaliers and Roundheads—tell in one form
or another the eternal tale of young adventurers in wild countries.

Marryat loved children and knew how to tell stories that they could like
and understand. This to-day is undisputed. But that he is equally a
novelist for the critical sorely needs reaffirmation. His juvenile
public has been more faithful to him than that of maturer years, and one
can only hope that time will restore him to the affection of the adult.
_Masterman Ready_ is as fresh to-day as when, eighty years ago, it first
appeared; but the freshness is due as much to Marryat as to his youthful
admirers, and that same freshness is no less present in the best of his
other books than it is in this children's classic. Let the modern novel
reader have no fear. In taking up _Japhet_, or _Peter Simple_, or _A
Pacha of Many Tales_, he will take up a fine book and good literature,
and not merely a poker with which to rake among the ashes of his own
vanished childhood.

    London: Bentley, 1872.

    Like so many loyal and affectionate biographers, Mrs. Ross Church is
    too casual a user of dates and too summary an adherent to chronology
    to allow to her book great reference value.

  LIFE OF FREDERICK MARRYAT. By DAVID HANNAY. London: Walter Scott.
    1889.

    This is an admirable little book so far as the main text is
    concerned. Its bibliography, however, although valuable for the list
    given of biographical and critical articles devoted to Marryat, as
    well as for facts regarding subsequent editions of Marryat's works,
    is very unreliable as an authority on first editions.

  A CODE OF SIGNALS FOR THE USE OF VESSELS EMPLOYED IN THE MERCHANT
    SERVICE. By CAPTAIN MARRYAT, R.N. Dedicated to the Committee of the
    Association of Shipowners of the Port of London. London: J. M.
    Richardson, 23 Cornhill. 1817. 1 vol. Royal 8vo (6⅛ × 9¾). No
    pagination, the book consisting wholly of tabulated code.
    Frontispiece, folding plate, and one full-page plate in colours.
    Paper boards, paper label on side only, printed in black. White
    end-papers.

      NOTE—I have only been able to consult the sixth edition of
      this book as issued revised in 1837 and a seventh edition,
      further revised, as issued in 1840; but that it appeared
      originally in the same form and over the same imprint is
      proved by the retention in the later edition of the author's
      original prefatory letter, dedicating his work to the
      Association of Shipowners.

      published by Saunders and Otley in 1837 in three volumes.
      Ex. cr. 8vo. Maroon embossed cloth, gilt. Yellow end-papers.

      (iii) It was the intention of the publishers to bring out an
      illustrated edition of all Marryat's novels, one novel to
      appear each month, beginning on April 1, 1837; but only
      _Jacob Faithful_ and _Peter Simple_ were issued, and the
      series was abandoned, doubtless because in that year Marryat
      quarrelled with Saunders and Otley and found a different
      publisher.

                                  1836

  THE PIRATE, AND THE THREE CUTTERS. By CAPTAIN MARRYAT, R.N.
    Illustrated with twenty splendid engravings from drawings by
    Clarkson Stanfield Esq., R.A. London: Published for the Proprietor
    by Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, Green and Longman. 1836. Large Med.
    8vo (5⅞ × 9⅛). Pp. (viii) + 315 + (1). The book contains twenty
    full-page illustrations in steel engraving, of which two—an engraved
    portrait frontispiece and picture title-page—precede printed title.
    Cream paper boards, gilt, lettered on spine in gold THE PIRATE BY
    CAPT^{N.} MARRYAT. Yellow end-papers.

      NOTES—(i) Although dated 1836, this book was actually
      published in December, 1835.

      (ii) Copies are more frequently met with in maroon cloth,
      blocked in gold and lettered on spine MARRYATS PIRATE AND
      THE THREE CUTTERS. This cloth binding (of which two styles
      at least are extant) is probably not so early in date as the
      paper-board binding described above. Definite information is
      impossible to obtain, but the evidence of similar
      illustrated books of the period (_e.g._, Lytton's _Pilgrims
      of the Rhine_) supports the theory here laid down.

      (iii) A large paper edition, imperial 8vo (11 × 7½), was
      issued simultaneously, with plates printed on India paper
      and bound in green paper boards, half dark-green figured
      cloth, cream paper label, the last being lettered in gold:
      THE PIRATE BY CAPT^{N.} MARRYAT. White end-papers. Copies of
      the large paper edition also exist in maroon cloth, blocked
      in gold and blind and lettered on the spine: MARRYATS PIRATE
      AND THE THREE CUTTERS. As with the ordinary edition, these
      full cloth copies are of later issue than those in boards.

      (iv) In all Longman's first editions the plates bear the
      following legend: 'Published Dec^r. 1, 1835 for the
      proprietor by Longman and Co., Paternoster Row.' The book
      was, however, never issued with a _printed_ title of that
      year. That the actual plates were published prior to the
      Longman book edition is proved by the fact that I have
      myself a set, both before and after “letters,” bearing the
      legend: 'London. Published Oct^r. 1835 for the proprietor by
      Charles Tilt, 86 Fleet Street.' In every other respect, even
      down to the page references, the wording on these early
      dated plates is identical with that used for Longman's book
      edition.

      (v) A curious feature of this book's publishing history is
      its issue in parts, nine years after its appearance in book
      form. In 1845 there appeared over the imprint A. Fullarton
      and Co., 106 Newgate Street, London; 67 Abbey street,
      Dublin; Steads Place, Leith Walk, and 5 Nicholson Street,
      Edinburgh, fifteen shilling parts (6 × 9½), bound in buff
      paper wrappers printed in red-brown, and illustrated with
      steel engravings after Clarkson Stanfield. These engravings
      are twenty in number and identical with those in the first
      book edition, except that the Longmans imprint has been
      substituted on the plates by that of Fullarton, and the
      printer's name and the date of issue have been expunged. The
      distribution of plates among the fifteen parts is as
      follows: Parts I. IV. VI. VIII. X. contain two plates each;
      Parts II. III. V. VII. IX. XI. XII. XIII. XIV. and XV.
      contain one plate each. Publishers' advertisements occupy
      outside back wrappers. No date appears on the parts, but a
      title-page (with other preliminary matter) enclosed in Part
      XV. is dated MDCCCXLV.

      The text of the book was clearly reset for this part issue,
      so there can be no question of a refurbishing of Longman
      sheets. It may be noted that, according to the wrappers, the
      plates were “engraved under the superintendence of Mr.
      Charles Heath.” (This person was responsible for the
      principal Books of Beauty, Keepsakes, and similar gift
      publications issued in large numbers toward Christmas time
      between 1840 and 1850 and distinguished by their beautiful
      steel engravings.)

      There being no indication that the plates were re-engraved
      for the Fullarton edition, it may be presumed either that
      Heath superintended their original production in 1835 but
      had not at that time the “selling name” that by 1845 was
      his, or that Fullarton, anxious to give to their reissue
      something of novelty, paid Heath for a supervisory activity
      of a nominal kind in order to have the use of his name on
      their wrappers.

      inclusion in _Olla Podrida_ in 1840.

  THE DIARY OF A BLASÉ. By the author of _Jacob Faithful_, _Peter

    Cr. 8vo (4¾ × 7¾). Pp. 197 + (1). Paper boards, paper label. White
    end-papers.

      NOTE—I cannot establish the month of publication of this
      book, but twenty-eight chapters of a work entitled _The
      Diary of a Blasé_ appeared serially in the “Metropolitan
      Magazine” to July, 1836, at which point the narrative was
      left incomplete. It made no separate appearance in book form
      in England, being included under the title _Diary on the
      Continent_ in _Olla Podrida_ (see below—1840).

      novel, because Saunders and Otley refused to pay an advance
      on royalties.

                                  1840

  POOR JACK. By CAPTAIN MARRYAT, C.B. With illustrations by Clarkson
    Stanfield, R.A. London: Longman, Orme, Brown, Green and Longmans,
    Paternoster Row. 1840. 1 vol. Large Med. 8vo (5⅞ × ¼). Pp. x + 384.
    Because the volume is composed of bound-up parts, the half-title is
    p. 1 of the story itself and does not precede frontispiece. The book
    contains forty-seven wood engravings after Clarkson Stanfield, of
    which thirty-six printed separately and eleven in the text. Dark
    green cloth, blocked in gold. Yellow end-papers.

      NOTES—(i) This book was published on December 1, 1840.

      (ii) _Poor Jack_ first appeared in twelve monthly shilling
      parts (5⅞ × 9), bound in buff paper wrappers, printed in
      black. The first was published at the beginning of January,
      and the last at the beginning of December, 1840. Each part
      (subject to the variations stated below) contained three
      full-page wood engravings after Clarkson Stanfield, printed
      separately. Eleven small engravings appear throughout the
      text.

      Included in Part XII. were title-page and preliminary matter
      (x pp.).

      Parts I. to III. were undated; Part IV. was dated April 1;
      and each succeeding part was dated similarly with the month
      of its appearance.

      Part I. should contain at front or back publishers'
      catalogue, 8 pp., dated January 1, 1840, and entitled “Poor
      Jack's Advertising Sheet.” Also at back an illustrated
      advertisement of _Paul Periwinkle_.

      Part II. should contain at front publishers' 4 pp. list,
      dated February, 1840, and a prospectus (8 pp., enclosed in
      buff wrappers) of McCulloch's Geographical, Statistical and
      Historical Dictionary.

      Parts III. to XI. contained (so far as I can discover) no
      advertising matter apart from that printed on the wrappers
      themselves.

      Part XII. should contain 2 pp. publishers' advertisements
      both at front and back, printed on the buff wrapper paper.


                          NOTES ON THE PLATES.

      (i) No plates were issued with Part IX., but six instead of
      three with Part X. A slip should be found inserted in Part
      IX. calling attention to the arrangement. My own set shows a
      similar happening in the case of Parts VII. and VIII., but
      there is no sign of a slip having figured in the former to
      explain the absence of illustration.

      (ii) In two cases there are variations in underline between
      part and book issue: (_a_) One of the plates included in
      Part XI. is entitled “The Euphrosyne in the Downs,” but this
      legend is omitted altogether in some copies of the book.
      (_b_) Included in Part XII. is a plate entitled “The Prize
      at Sheerness.” This underline reads in most copies of the
      book “The Prize in The Medway.” Collectors anxious to
      possess the actual first issue of the book—_i.e._, that
      bound up from actual parts—should examine these two points
      in copies they consider purchasing.

  MASTERMAN READY OR THE WRECK OF THE PACIFIC. Written for Young People.
    By CAPTAIN MARRYAT. London: Longman, Orme, Brown, Green and
    Longmans, Paternoster Row. 1841 (Vol. I.), 1842 (Vols. II. and
    III.). 3 vols. in all. Fcap. 8vo (4¼ × 6¾).

    Vol. I. pp. viii + 287 + (1). Publishers' catalogue, 16 pp., dated
    February, 1841, bound in at end.

    Vol. II. pp. (iv) + 269 + (3). Publishers' catalogue, 16 pp. (maybe
    two catalogues each of 16 pp.), dated April, 1842, bound in at end
    or, in some cases, after first front end-paper.

    Vol. III. pp. (iv) + 225 + (3). Publishers' catalogue, 30 pp., dated
    October, 1842, bound in at end.

    Each volume contains frontispiece (that to Vol. III. is a map) and
    several text illustrations, wood engraved and printed on text paper.
    Dark green cloth, gilt, blocked in blind. Yellow end-papers.

      NOTES—(i) Vol. I. was published in May, 1841; Vol. II. in
      April, 1842; and Vol. III. in December, 1842.

      (ii) Because the book was first planned to occupy one volume
      only, there is no indication on Vol. I. of its being the
      first of a series. Vols. II. and III., however, are so
      described on title-page and on binding.

      (iii) Vol. I. was catalogued on its publication as bound in
      “boards.” This indicates that copies were first issued with
      paper label and in half cloth, but I have never seen one so
      bound.

    vols. Fcap. 8vo (4⅛ × 6¾).

    paper. Grey-brown cloth, gilt, blocked in blind. Pale yellow
    end-papers.

      NOTES—(i) This book was published on September 7, 1844. It
      is possible that the earliest issue contained an undated
      catalogue, but this can only be established by comparison
      between a larger number of copies of the book than I have
      contrived to examine, and a careful investigation of the
      books listed in any such undated catalogue.

      (ii) I have seen an announcement of this book as in
      “boards,” but have never met with copies so bound.


                                  1845

                                  1846

  THE PRIVATEER'S-MAN: ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO. By CAPTAIN MARRYAT, R.N.
    London: Longman, Brown, Green and Longmans, Paternoster Row. 1846. 2
    vols. Fcap. 8vo (4¼ × 6¾).

    Vol. I. pp. (iv) + 379 + (1). Publishers' catalogue, dated July,
    1846, or earlier, bound in at end.

    Vol. II. pp. (iv) + 361 + (1).

    Grey-green cloth, gilt, blocked in blind. Yellow end-papers.

      appeared serially in the “New Monthly Magazine,” which
      periodical had just been purchased by W. Harrison Ainsworth.


                                 [1847]

  THE CHILDREN OF THE NEW FOREST. By CAPTAIN MARRYAT, R.N. London: H.
    Hurst, 27 King William Street, Charing Cross. 2 vols. Fcap. 8vo (4¼
    × 6¾).

    Vol. I. pp. (iv) [enclosing inset title-page printed in red and
    green] + 288 + (2).

    Vol. II. pp. (iv) [enclosing inset title-page printed in red and
    green] + 298 + (4).

    Vol. I. contains eight and Vol. II. four steel-engraved
    illustrations by Frank Marryat, printed separately.

      NOTES—(i) This book was the first story in _The Juvenile
      Library_. Vol. I. was published in July and Vol. II. in
      October, 1847. In all the copies I have been able to examine
      pp. (299) to (302) of Vol. II. are occupied by an
      announcement of this library and by reviews of _The Children
      of the New Forest_ itself. Whether the book, on its actual
      first appearance, had these pages blank or otherwise
      occupied I do not know, but it is certainly curious to find
      press notices of a story in any but subsequent issues of
      that story. It should be noted that the pages in question
      are not inset, but form the last quarter of a 16 pp. sheet.

      (ii) It is rumoured in some quarters that the book, as
      originally issued, was dated on the title-page. I have never
      seen a copy so dated.


                                 1848/9

    green] + 298 + (4). Advertisements and reviews paged 1-4 of _The
    Juvenile Library_ and _The Children of the New Forest_ occupy pp.
    (299) to (302).

    Part II. pp. (iv.) [enclosing inset title-page printed in red and
    green] + 280 + (4). Advertisements and reviews of Part I. and of

    New Forest_.

      NOTES—(i) Part I. was published in December, 1848, and Part
      II. in February, 1849.

      (ii) The second edition of Part II. differs from the first
      in that there are preliminary pages (viii), of which p. (v)
      bears a note by the author's son referring to Captain
      Marryat's death. Frontispiece and title-page are, as
      previously, inset on different paper, and the latter printed
      in red and green.

      (iii) Of Part II. only two chapters were written by Marryat.


                                  1849

  VALERIE: AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY. By CAPTAIN MARRYAT, R.N. Author of _Peter
    Simple_, _Frank Mildmay_ etc. London: Henry Colburn, Publisher,
    Great Marlborough Street. 1849. 2 vols. Ex. Cr. 8vo (4¾ × 7¾).

    Vol. I. pp. (iv) + 312. Publisher's advertisements, 2 pp., printed
    on text paper bound in at end.

    Vol. II. pp. (iv) + 287 + (1). Advertisement of _Frank Mildmay_
    occupies p. (288).

    Paper boards, half cloth, paper label. Also grey-green cloth, gilt,
    blocked in blind. White end-papers.

      NOTE—This book was published in June, 1849. The story—to the
      end of Vol. II., chap. iii.—appeared serially in the “New
      Monthly Magazine” during 1846 and 1847. Owing to illness,
      Marryat was unable to complete the book, which was finished
      by another hand.


II.—A BOOK ATTRIBUTED TO MARRYAT, ONE EDITED BY HIM AND OTHERS POSSIBLY
                         WRITTEN WITH HIS HELP


                                  1836

  THE FLORAL TELEGRAPH: A New Mode of Communication by floral signals.
    With Plates. London: Saunders and Otley, Conduit Street. MDCCCXXXVI.
    1 vol. Fcap. 8vo (4¼ × 6¾). Pp. xv + (i) + 307 + (11). Publishers'
    advertisements occupy pp. (309) to (318)—others face title-page. The
    book contains six hand-coloured plates, printed separately.
    Olive-green cloth, blocked in gold and blind. Yellow end-papers.

      NOTES—(i) This book was published in December, 1836. It was
      reissued, probably in 1850, with a cancel title-page
      reading: “The Floral Telegraph or Affection's Signals” by
      the late Captain Marryatt [_sic_] R.N., author of _Peter
      Simple_ etc. London: Saunders and Otley, Conduit Street. The
      pagination reads: xv + (i) + 324. Pp. xv + (i) + 189 + (1)
      are identical in the two editions, which are probably to
      this point composed of the same sheets. The second half of
      the book has, however, been reset, altered, and extended.
      The illustrations are the same as in the earlier edition,
      but they are much more coarsely reproduced and mechanically
      coloured. Olive-green cloth, similar to the first edition,
      but differently blocked in gold. Yellow end-papers.

      (ii) It is a moot point whether or not Marryat was the
      author of this rather foolish little book. That he had,
      however, definite connection with it is suggested by the
      fact that on its first publication the “Metropolitan
      Magazine,” at that time closely identified with Marryat,
      devoted to it a three-quarter-page highly laudatory review,
      of which, after praising the introduction, the writer said:
      “Though no name is found on the title-page, it is evident
      that the work is from a practised and popular writer.”
      Further, if Marryat were not the author, it is difficult to
      understand the publishers' motive in reissuing it
      immediately after his death with his name on the title-page.
      If he deserves responsibility for the book, the manœuvre is
      comprehensible enough, especially on the part of a firm with
      whom he had severed relations in 1837, and thus deprived
      them of the profitable exploitation of his established
      reputation.


                                  1836

  RATTLIN THE REEFER. Edited by the author of _Peter Simple_. “All hands
    reef top-sails—Away, Aloft!” London: Richard Bentley, New Burlington
    Street, Successor to Henry Colburn. 1836. 3 vols. Ex. Cr. 8vo (4¾ ×
    7¾).

    Vol. I. pp. xii + (ii) + 301 + (3). Note by Marryat stating his
    connection with the work occupies p. (iv). Publisher's
    advertisements occupy pp. (303) (304).

    Vol. II. pp. viii + 300. No half-title to this volume.

    Vol. III. pp. viii + 344. No half-title to this volume.

    Each volume contains three full-page etched illustrations by A.
    Hervieu, of which one is a frontispiece and the other two in the
    course of the text. A list of illustrations for the three volumes
    occupies p. (xiii) of Vol. I. The illustrations are dated 1836.
    Paper boards, paper label. White end-papers.

      NOTE—This book, which was written by Edward Howard (see p.
      100), was published on July 23, 1836. A second edition
      appeared on August 5 of the same year. A dramatic version by
      J. T. Haines (who also dramatized _Jacob Faithful_) was
      issued in February, 1893, as No. 2008 in French's Acting
      Editions of British Plays.

      Two-thirds of the story appeared serially in the
      “Metropolitan Magazine” under the title, _The Life of a
      Sub-Editor_. Reviewing the book in its three-volume form,
      Marryat himself explained fully how and to what extent it
      had been transformed from a record of autobiographical fact
      to a frank experiment in fiction.


                                 _NOTE_

The six items that follow are, like _Rattlin the Reefer_, the work of
Lieut. the Hon. Edward Granville George Howard, who worked as sub-editor
to Marryat on the “Metropolitan Magazine.” At one time the actual
authorship of Howard's books was ascribed to Marryat himself. This is
now proved to be a mistake. Indeed, apart from the note of
recommendation to _Rattlin the Reefer_ and Marryat's review of that book
in his magazine, there is no printed evidence that he had any share
whatever in the composition of any one of them. On the other hand, he
and Howard were very intimate; the stories of the latter are clearly
influenced by the work of his chief; and Marryat collectors have been in
the habit of regarding Howard's books as desirable adjuncts to a Marryat
collection. For which reasons, and because it is no less probable than
improbable that Marryat, in conversation if not by actual pencraft,
helped to give his sub-editor's books their final shape, I have thought
well to include them in this bibliography.

                     _A NOTE ON MARRYAT AS ARTIST_

It is well known that Captain Marryat was a painter as well as a writer.
Collectors of his written work will perhaps also be interested to know
of a published book containing in reproduction some of his drawings. In
1825 or 1826 there appeared the following work:

  ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE BURMESE WAR. Both Series. With twenty-four plates
    after drawings by Captain Marryat, Thornton and Moore displaying the
    Operations of the British Forces. London: Published by Thomas Clay.
    (N.D.) The volume measures 20½ × 13¼, is bound in thick grey paper
    wrappers lettered in black as above, and contains five engravings of
    pictures painted by Stothard and D. Cox after drawings by Captain
    Marryat. The name Kingsbury and Co., 6 Leadenhall Street, appears at
    the foot of the engravings as their publisher, together with the
    date 1825.




                           BENJAMIN DISRAELI
                               1804-1881




                           BENJAMIN DISRAELI


It is easier to blame historians and political critics of the life and
statesmanship of Disraeli for neglecting his novels, than it is oneself
to judge these novels as literature, apart from the huge mass of
incident, ambition, and achievement that went to make up the character
of their extraordinary author. To attempt in a few pages an estimate of
Disraeli as a man of letters were manifestly absurd, seeing that he was
rarely that and nothing else. It were doubly absurd, even if possible,
to treat in summary of the interactions of his political and literary
genius when one of the finest biographies of modern times (and that in
six volumes) has already covered every inch of the ground. The only
purpose, therefore, which these unauthoritative notes may serve is that
of indicating in a few words the development of Disraeli as a novelist
and the respective content of his principal books.

Although his novels fall into distinct and different groups, they are
all primarily satirical in character. From the moment of the anonymous
but sensational appearance of _Vivian Grey_ to that of the publication
of _Endymion_ which bore on each of its three volumes the name of the
most distinguished statesman of the world, Disraeli held up alike to the
follies and the ideals of his age the mirror of a keen and ruthless
mind.

But if he gazed on his contemporaries more often from the angle of
satire than from any other, he enclosed in their various frames the
period portraits that are his books. As a very young man—unknown,
ambitious, at once receptive and intensely sensitive—he used as material
for fiction not only the incidents of his own life, but, even more, the
thoughts and aspirations that filled his teeming brain. _Vivian Grey_
(1826-7), _Contarini Fleming_ (1833), and _Alroy_ (1833) are mainly
interesting as autobiography, and to the use of personal experience as
material for novel-writing he returned in extreme old age when, looking
back from the splendid eminence of his power, he described in the pages
of _Endymion_ the long road that he had travelled from obscurity to
fame.

_Vivian Grey_ appeared in five volumes, with an interval of a year
between the issue of the first two and that of the last three. But for
the brilliant publicity given to it by Colburn, the book would have
attracted little or no attention. It is a showy, careless pastiche of
the society of the day, a gallery of isolated portraits rather than a
single composition, attractive to the fashionable public of the time for
its thinly veiled presentment of well-known men and women. The reader is
further unpleasantly aware that the author's interest in his book did
not extend much beyond the first of the five volumes. Young men find it
easier to start a book than to finish one, and Disraeli was clearly no
exception to the rule.

_Contarini Fleming_ and _Alroy_, written after an extended tour in the
East, show, at its most luxuriant and ornate, the author's talent for
heady, rhetorical prose. Like most of his race, Disraeli was more
susceptible to magnificence and to decoration than to severe simplicity,
and throughout his books was prone to an excessive use of epithet and
metaphor. If these two early books show his love of ornament more
shamelessly than those written at a maturer age, they can claim
nevertheless to have received more careful and conscientious working, so
that their embellishments, if too lavish, are at least scrupulously
fashioned.

Between the publication of the last three volumes of _Vivian Grey_ and
that of the story of _Contarini Fleming_ Disraeli published two works of
fiction which, although in the matter of primary characteristic isolated
from the rest of his work and from each other, contain elements that
constantly reappear in the books of his later life.

_The Voyage of Captain Popanilla_ (1828) is a satire on English
political and social institutions cast in the form of an inverted
_Gulliver's Travels_ or _Erewhon_. Instead of an Englishman reaching an
imaginary and fantastic land, where he finds conditions that correspond
partly to the prejudices, partly to the ideals, of the author, the hero
of Disraeli's satire is a being from a mythical world, who comes over
the sea to an island that is, in all but name, England as Disraeli saw
it. As an example of pertinacious and aggressive parody _The Voyage of
Captain Popanilla_ is witty and readable enough, but it fatigues, as do
all pastiches of the kind, by its somewhat literal pursuit of
contemporary activity. Disraeli should have limited his prospect of
satire, for the individual beauties of any view are appreciated in
proportion to the smallness of their number. _Popanilla_ is overcrowded,
and the reader's mind tires with the effort to solve the riddle that is
contained in nearly every paragraph.

_The Young Duke_ (1831) was written to make money. One may go farther
and confess that the author, seeking frankly to profit by the
contemporary popularity of the novel of fashionable life, wrote a tale
of society into which he crammed all that he knew of character and
incident likely to appeal to the mood of the moment. With such
antecedents it is surprising that _The Young Duke_ is not a worse book
than it is. Inevitably it reads artificially, and the young writer had
not the skill entirely to conceal the wilfulness with which the work was
put together. On the other hand, the heroine deserves the attention of
Disraeli students, for she is the direct forerunner of Sybil, and that
part of _The Young Duke_ which depends on her personality is not without
a touch of the four great political novels upon which Disraeli's fame as
a writer must rest.

It was four years after the publication of _Alroy_ that Disraeli next
appeared as a novelist. He then published, within six months of one
another, two stories that stand markedly apart from the rest of his
work, in that they are wholly without political significance. Even amid
the extravagance of _Contarini Fleming_ and _The Young Duke_ occur
passages that depend for their significance on political movements or
political thought of the time. _Vivian Grey_, being a _roman à clef_ of
high society, and _Popanilla_ being a direct satire of institutions, are
naturally full of what was, even in those days, the author's ruling
interest. But _Henrietta Temple_ (1837) and _Venetia_ (1837) are
romances pure and simple. They may be said also to have no
autobiographical significance, save in so far as the first part of the
earlier book was written under the stimulus of a real love affair. It
must be admitted that _Henrietta Temple_, once it gets beyond the
boundary of Disraeli's own passionate experience, is a tame and careless
book. The interval that passed between the writing of the earlier and
that of the later portion seems to have extinguished his enthusiasm for
the work. Colburn was clamouring for a novel, and Disraeli, as always
hard pressed for money, raked out his incomplete manuscript, furbished
it up, finished it off, and delivered it to the publisher. _Venetia_ has
not this fault of interrupted fashioning. It is, however, in one
reader's opinion at any rate, a very tedious affair—rhetorical, unreal,
and sluggish in movement; but this view is contrary to that held by
many, who consider that the book's portraiture gives it value as
commentary on the life of Byron and other famous people.

There follows, this time after an interval of seven years, the first of
the four famous political novels that, whether or no they can be said to
have introduced a new genre into English fiction, are undoubtedly the
finest achievements of Disraeli's literary career. _Coningsby_ (1844),
_Sybil_ (1845), and _Tancred_ (1847) are too well known to need
description here. Because, however, their interdependence as parts of a
general scheme in the mind of the author tends to become obscured by
consideration of their respective quality, note may be taken of the fact
that _Coningsby_ is a novel of political views, _Sybil_ one of social
conditions and classes among the people, and _Tancred_ one of religion
as an influence in national life. Of the characters in _Coningsby_ many
reappear in _Tancred_, while Tadpole and Taper, whose names have become
part of English political slang, pull their wires and cadge their jobs
as assiduously in _Sybil_ as in the story that preceded it. It would be
interesting to work out a comparison between Disraeli and Trollope as
political novelists. Probably one would come to the decision that those
of Disraeli are the better political novels and those of Trollope the
better novels of politics. In other words, Disraeli is the cleverer
publicist, but Trollope the finer artist. _Coningsby_ and its fellows
depend very much on contemporary fact and personality for their full
understanding and significance. Surely it is not hyperæsthetic to demand
that literature be its own interpreter? In so far as a work of art
requires outside knowledge for its proper appreciation, to that extent
it falls short from what in art is highest and most perfect.

The appearance of _Lothair_ in 1870 caused something of a scandal in
serious political circles. The Briton is accustomed to take his
statesmen seriously, but his novelists with frivolity and in the leisure
hour. Wherefore he regarded it as unseemly that the name of an ex-Prime
Minister and of a man whose political career was by no means run should
figure on the title-pages of a three-volume novel. Curiosity conquered
disapproval and, as on an hundred other occasions, a book condemned for
its very existence was purchased and read in tens of thousands.
_Lothair_ is the work of a man who knew everybody and almost everything.
The personal satire, the constructive and destructive fervour of
_Coningsby_, _Sybil_, and _Tancred_ have given place to a greater
gravity and restraint, to an ironic vision more general and less
individual. Taking as his subject the power of the Catholic Church, the
rival power of revolutionary free thought and the indeterminate central
position of the Church of England, Disraeli built up his fourth and most
extensive picture of the England of his time. If we miss the idealist
conviction that gives to some of the passages in _Tancred_ the force of
a splendid sermon, we gain a certainty and a dignity of thought which
were inevitably lacking in the books of the earlier period. We also
continue to enjoy the epigram, the vivid minor portraiture, the
lightning grasp of fact and of every implication of fact, that give to
the political novels of Disraeli their unique flavour and importance.

      publishers' catalogue, 8 pp., dated April, 1832. Clearly it
      did not belong to the first issue, but what date should be
      found on a catalogue of the earliest issue, where in the
      three volumes such a catalogue should appear, or whether
      there should be a catalogue at all, I do not know.

      I. containing a preface in explanation of the author's
      action in putting his name to the book. Consequently from
      the purist point of view the Moxon edition of 1834 should be
      collected as containing fresh matter. It was bound in pale
      maroon cloth, with paper label. Yellow end-papers.

    wrapper and bears the words “Price Sixpence.” P. 16 serves as back
    wrapper. Advertisements occupy p. (2).

      NOTE—The above notation was made from a copy of the “New
      Edition, Revised” of the pamphlet. Since, however, this
      first appeared in the same year and over the same imprint, I
      have ventured to assume comparative uniformity of size and
      appearance.

      NOTES—(i) This pamphlet was issued in December, 1834.

      (ii) The above observations were made from a rebound copy,
      wherefore the style of binding is an assumption, and I
      suspect that two or more flyleaves—maybe printed with
      advertisements—should be added to the reckoning here set
      down.

    POPANILLA. THE TRAGEDY OF COUNT ALARCOS. By BENJAMIN DISRAELI.
    London: David Bryce, 48 Paternoster Row. 1853. 1 vol. Cloth.

    This little book—a volume in a cheap reissue of the novels and
    romances of Disraeli—is the first _book_ edition of _Ixion in
    Heaven_ and _The Infernal Marriage_, which first appeared in the
    “New Monthly” in 1829 and 1830, and had not been reprinted in the
    interval.

  THE REVOLUTIONARY EPICK. By the Right Honorable BENJAMIN DISRAELI.
    London: Longman, Green, Longman, Roberts and Green. 1864. 1 vol.
    Small Cr. 8vo (4½ × 7⅛). Pp. (xiv) [paged as (ii) + x + (ii)] + 176

    (vii) and (viii). Preface reprinted from the original edition
    occupies pp. (ix) to (xii). Brown cloth, gilt. Chocolate end-papers.

      NOTE—The text of this edition differs extensively both in
      wording and length from that of 1834. In his preface the
      author states that the work was completed in 1837, but,
      through press of political duties, he made no arrangement
      for its issue before the present date. He also avers that
      only fifty copies of the edition of 1834 were printed.

       II.—BOOKS PARTIALLY WRITTEN OR EDITED BY BENJAMIN DISRAELI


                                  1825

  THE LIFE OF PAUL JONES. From original documents in the possession of
    John Henry Sherburne Esq., Register of the Navy of the United
    States. London: John Murray, Albemarle Street. MDCCCXXV. 1 vol. Ex.
    Cr. 8vo (4¾ × 7¾). Pp. xii + 320. Paper boards, paper label. White
    end-papers.

      NOTES—(i) With reference to this book Monypenny says: “The
      exact relationship of the English book to the American
      original is not clear; but the former seems also to have
      been written by an American, and the original MS., which has
      been preserved, shows that Disraeli's share in it was
      limited to the introduction here and there of a word or
      phrase where the excision of a passage rendered such
      amendment necessary.” In addition to the corrections thus
      described Disraeli contributed an anonymous preface to the
      book.

      (ii) It is interesting to record here that in 1844 Captain
      Marryat was asked to write a life of Paul Jones. He was
      interested in the project, but it never materialized.


                                  1826

  THE STAR CHAMBER. A Weekly Magazine published by William Marsh, 145
    Oxford Street. 9/8 numbers Demy 8vo (5½ × 8¾) were published: No. 1,
    April 19, pp. 1 to 20; Nos. 2 and 3 (double number), April 26, pp.
    21 to 58; No. 4, May 3, pp. 59 to 74; No. 5, May 10, pp. 75 to 90;
    No. 6, May 17, pp. 91 to 110; No. 7, May 24, pp. 111 to 126; No. 8,
    May 31, pp. 127 to 142; No. 9, June 7, pp. 143 to 154.

After the completion of the 9/8 numbers, a four-page sheet of
preliminary matter was issued, of which p. (i) reads:

  THE STAR CHAMBER. Vol. I. Part 1. April 19 to June 7, 1826. (Quotation
    from Cavendish, “Wolsey.”) London: William Marsh, 145 Oxford Street.
    Pp. (iii) and (iv) are occupied by contents list.

      NOTES—(i) At one time the responsibility for the whole
      contents as well as for the editorship of the “Star Chamber”
      was fathered upon Disraeli. Monypenny, however, combats this
      theory. He says: “The 'Star Chamber' was founded by a
      certain Peter Hall, a friend of Meredith's at Brasenose,
      who, through Meredith, had become acquainted with Disraeli.
      Disraeli contributed some fables with a political
      application under the title of _The Modern Aesop_, and
      perhaps other matter. But in later life he expressly denied
      ('The Times,' November 3, 1871; the 'Leisure Hour,' November
      4, 1871) having been editor, if indeed there ever was an
      editor.” This represents, of course, the most recent and
      authoritative opinion on the matter; but it is interesting,
      on p. 150 of the catalogue of the Hope collection of
      newspapers, etc., in the Bodleian Library at Oxford (1865),
      to find reasons given for the suppression by Disraeli of all
      copies of the “Star Chamber” upon which he could lay his
      hands. The Peter Hall referred to above was the Reverend
      Peter Hall, B.A., editor of “The Crypt.”

      (ii) It is because the “Star Chamber” has come to be looked
      upon as a Disraeli item that I have included it here,
      despite the fact that in so doing I exceed the limit of
      these bibliographies, which take no account of magazine
      contributions of the authors concerned.


                               1849-1859

  THE WORKS OF ISAAC DISRAELI. Edited with Introductions by BENJAMIN
    DISRAELI.

Disraeli started work on a new edition of his father's books in 1847,
but the actual publication was, for various reasons, spread over a
period of ten years. The following are the dates and details in outline
of the first issues of the various titles:

  1849. CURIOSITIES OF LITERATURE. London: Edward Moxon. 3 vols. Demy
    8vo (5½ × 8¾). Dark green cloth, gilt. Yellow end-papers. Vol. I.
    contains “A View of the Life and Writings” of Isaac Disraeli written
    by his son and extending to over thirty pages.

  1851. COMMENTARIES ON THE LIFE AND REIGN OF CHARLES THE FIRST, KING OF
    ENGLAND. London: Henry Colburn. 2 vols. Demy 8vo (5½ × 8¾). Dark
    green cloth, gilt. Yellow end-papers. Vol. I. contains a brief
    preface by Benjamin Disraeli.

  1859. THE LITERARY CHARACTER Or THE HISTORY OF MEN OF GENIUS; and
    LITERARY MISCELLANIES and AN ENQUIRY INTO THE CHARACTER OF JAMES THE
    FIRST. 1 vol. Cr. 8vo.

  1859. THE CALAMITIES AND QUARRELS OF AUTHORS. 1 Vol. Cr. 8vo.

  1859. AMENITIES OF LITERATURE. 2 vols. Cr. 8vo.

These last three items were all published in London by Routledge, Warnes
and Routledge, and bound in dark green cloth, with yellow end-papers.
They contain no prefaces by Benjamin Disraeli, who contented himself
with care for the text of his father's work.


                                 _NOTE_

To a collected edition of his novels issued in 1870 Disraeli wrote an
important preface, characterising the work of his youth from the
viewpoint of a man in his sixties and indicating the considerable
revisions carried out in nearly all the books.

No attempt has been made to include in the foregoing bibliography the
reports of and selections from the speeches of Disraeli, which—not
surprisingly—were issued in large numbers during his later life. Also
are omitted two volumes of his early letters, published after his death.




                             WILKIE COLLINS
                               1824-1889




                             WILKIE COLLINS


Few novelists have enjoyed greater glory than did Wilkie Collins at the
height of his fame; to few did loss of popularity in later years come
more bitterly. For fame at one time undeniably was his. Not only had he
a large and enthusiastic public; not only were his works translated into
half a dozen languages within a month of their original publication; not
only was he pestered by the editors of two hemispheres for stories and
serials; but also he figured prominently in the professional literary
life of the time, was the intimate friend of Dickens, and a member of
the innermost ring of artistic and intellectual society. Probably to his
intimacy with the chief literary personalities of his time is due the
considerable survival of his reputation. Despite the fact that during
the last period of his life he suffered severe eclipse, and although,
beyond _The Moonstone_ and _The Woman in White_, none of his books are
regularly read to-day, he is a name more familiar to the world than
Trollope, a name more notably literary than Marryat. In the sixties, no
less than in the nineteen-twenties, to belong to the writing set was
two-thirds of reputation. There is no log-rolling so expert, no
admiration so mutual as that existing among members of the various
groups that practise the arts. Whence it has come about that the name of
Wilkie Collins—who as an artist may not be mentioned in the same chapter
as Trollope or Marryat, or even Mrs. Gaskell—is a household word, while
those of his greater fellows sound strangely, as the notes of some
old-fashioned melody.

I do not seek to imply that Collins' survival is in no way due to the
quality of his work. He won the admiration of his own age and may claim
that of posterity as a superb teller of stories and, in his latter days,
as a pathetic and courageous figure. But apart from his dexterity in the
contriving of plot, apart from a great (if intermittent) talent for the
portrayal of abnormal character, he is inferior as a painter of life to
many writers of his time whose very existence is nowadays forgotten.

And yet he would, perhaps, himself be content to have it so. That it was
the novelist's primary duty to tell a story was his own creed, and
faithfully he abode by it. He does not reveal to us human nature as does
Trollope; nor, like Disraeli, pique our interest with satiric brilliance
on topics of follies of the day; he has none of Marryat's gay
familiarity with the winds that blow and the sun that shines on the
crossroads of life's pilgrimage; he has no fund of rough but genial
humanity like Reade; he is not tender like Mrs. Gaskell, nor mystic
visionary like Herman Melville; even Whyte Melville, with his stilted
rhetoric and clumsy naïveté, has at times an attractive freshness that
Collins lacks. But if we rid our minds of all thought of him as seeking
to throw on the dark places of existence the light of interpretation,
looking to him rather for entertainment and for excitement, for deft
mystery and for extraordinary coincidence, he will not disappoint us.

Of his novels the largest category, and that including all the books
(save perhaps two) that bear re-reading nowadays, is that of the
dramatic and mystery stories.

The first to appear was _After Dark_, published in 1856. To the modern
reader, the unmistakable first appearance of the real Collins in these
excellent tales comes with a pleasurable shock after the mild
bohemianism of the preceding novel, _Hide and Seek_. _After Dark_
consists of six narratives of varying length and subject, ingeniously
woven together into the pattern of a single story. At their best they
are as good as anything the author ever wrote; even at their worst they
are free from the perfunctory carelessness that mars so much of his
later work.

_The Dead Secret_ (1857) and _The Queen of Hearts_ (1859) show the
novelist carrying farther his talent for dramatic construction and his
experiments in technique. Both books contain descriptive passages of
sombre power.

There follow successively the four best books of Collins' career. _The
Woman in White_ (1860), _No Name_ (1862), _Armadale_ (1866), and _The
Moonstone_ (1868) are story-telling as fine as the nineteenth century
can show. But they make evident that, even at his zenith, Collins was no
reader of other men's hearts. He could fashion ingenious puppets to his
will, entangling them in the meshes of his intricate and faultlessly
constructed plots; but neither Count Fosco nor Captain Wragge, neither
Miss Gwilt nor Sergeant Cuff, remains with the reader as a new friend or
as a new enemy. Each is remembered, rather, as a striking and skilfully
designed marionette, jerking through a Collins drama at the bidding of a
delicate mechanism of strings.

After _The Moonstone_ the decadence began, and, to a point, accountably
enough. In the first place, the author threw himself into the production
of propaganda fiction, with results (as may be seen) praiseworthy but a
little ridiculous. Secondly, he paid the usual price of success and
began to over-write. Whereas between 1850 and 1868 he published eleven
novels and books of tales, between 1870 and his death in 1889 he
published eighteen, in addition to a mass of short stories for
magazines, plays, and other incidental work. Thirdly—although not until
late in the seventies—his health began to fail. With reasons as good as
these for a falling off in Collins' work, it were ungracious to inquire
whether, had he eschewed reform, controlled his pen, and retained his
strength and eyesight, his fiction would have advanced from strength to
strength. Perhaps; perhaps not. Let us return from hypothetical dilemma
to melancholy fact. After _The Moonstone_ the decadence unmistakably
began.

When next he came before the public with a novel of plot, and left for a
moment the righting of public wrongs, his offering was mechanical
enough. _The Two Destinies_ (1876) is built on a series of coincidences
so incredible, that even Collins' candid claim to search the very
border-line of impossibility for material of which to make a story
cannot reconcile us to their unlikelihood.

_The Haunted Hotel_ (1879), _Jezebel's Daughter_ (1880), and _I Say No_
(1884) mark a slight improvement, and can be read with pleasure for the
unfailing ingenuity of their design. _The Evil Genius_ (1886) is in the
nature of a bad relapse, from which the dramatic tales never wholly
recover, although, of the three remaining, _Little Novels_ (1887) and
_The Legacy of Cain_ (1889) are not without flashes of the old skill and
invention. _Blind Love_, finished by Sir Walter Besant and published
posthumously, may perhaps claim immunity from criticism.

As a novelist of indignation Collins is pathetic rather than
blameworthy. He had the usual fanaticisms of the invalid
intellectual—hatred of athleticism, of sport, of legal injustice, of
religious intrigue, of social insincerity; and his propaganda novels
give expression to his passionate dislikes with a petulant but rather
impressive sincerity. Fortunately for the modern reader of books which
by their very nature are now out of date, Collins did not fail, even in
his tilting at windmills, to regulate his movements with practised
skill. Wherefore all but one of the propaganda novels have
well-contrived plots and continuity of interest, which those will enjoy
who can disentangle the fictional from the instructional in the stories'
purpose. These “indignation novels” are six in number:

                      MAN AND WIFE (1870),
                      THE NEW MAGDALEN (1873),
                      THE LAW AND THE LADY (1875),
                      THE FALLEN LEAVES (1879),
                      THE BLACK ROBE (1871), and
                      HEART AND SCIENCE (1883).

That in other books are present elements of reforming zeal I am
aware—for example, the abuse of private asylums figures in _The Woman in
White_ and, as mentioned below, there is a propaganda aspect to _Basil_;
but the six above named have their origin wholly in the author's
loathing of some injustice or some social evil.

_Man and Wife_ illustrates the cruel working of the marriage laws of the
United Kingdom and, incidentally, voices the author's conviction that
athleticism was at the time rapidly brutalizing the youth of England.
_The Law and the Lady_ ventilates another grievance against legal
injustice in matters sexual. _The New Magdalen_ and _The Fallen Leaves_
are protests against the outlawry of the prostitute and of the girl who
gives herself, unhallowed by the religious rite, to love. It is strange
that, of two books on the same subject, one (_The New Magdalen_) should
be the best novel of its class and not far below the highest level ever
attained by the author, while the other (_The Fallen Leaves_) should
hold the last place among everything that Collins wrote. _The New
Magdalen_ is a moving and dignified treatment of a very difficult theme;
_The Fallen Leaves_, from its aggressive preface to its sugary, unreal
end, is tragic proof that high motive and technical efficiency may yet
come together and produce only imbecile hysteria.

_The Black Robe_ is anti-Jesuit; _Heart and Science_ anti-vivisection.
Both are readable, and the latter something more. It may be noted that
Collins himself called _Heart and Science_ his best novel since _Man and
Wife_. Probably opinion to-day would set it above that humourless and
over-appendixed story, but it must rank below _The New Magdalen_ and,
possibly, also below _The Haunted Hotel_.

The novels that remain may hardly be classified. _Antonina_, the story
of Ancient Rome, with which in 1850, and following a fashion of the day,
he began his novelist's career, is essentially a first book—painstaking,
over-elaborate, and dull.

It was succeeded by _Mr. Wray's Cash Box_ (1852), a brief and
sentimental tale, mainly interesting for the evidence it provides of
Dickens's influence over the young Collins at the very beginning of
their long friendship. Those who enjoy hearty Christmas jollity, lovable
if ludicrous old age, uncouth fidelity, incompetent villainy, and sweet
simple maidenhood will find _Mr. Wray's Cash Box_ pleasant enough.

_Basil_ (1852) and _Hide and Seek_ (1854) are novels of contemporary
life, a little sombre, emotionally a little exaggerated. There is a hint
of crusading fervour in _Basil_ (against drunken nurses and hospital
routine), but the motif is not strong enough to class the book as a
propaganda novel. The young author (as many both before and since have
done) found stimulus for these books in the pathetic figure of the
debauched girl; but she receives at his hands treatment little different
from that usually given her by serious neophytes, eager to paint her
tragic isolation for the improvement of the novel-reading public.

There is in _Hide and Seek_ an element of interest apart from that of
the story itself. Much of the action takes place in a painter's studio,
and Collins has full scope for showing his fondness for art, an
enthusiasm suitable enough in the son and biographer of a distinguished
painter, but somewhat uncommon among novelists of his age. Throughout
his work he makes play with knowledge of contemporary painting,
displaying decided and on the whole admirable taste, often well in
advance of his time.

_Poor Miss Finch_ (1872) is more a story of contemporary social life
than either a novel of mystery or one of propaganda. It may therefore
appear here as pendant to the two early books just described. The
central figure is a blind girl. In _Hide and Seek_ the author took
credit to himself for introducing a deaf mute, but as the affliction
plays no part in the story one must refrain from joining in the
applause. The blindness of Miss Finch, on the other hand, is the pivot
of her tale, and a very elaborate, improbable, and overcrowded tale it
is. The fact is regrettable. Neatly contrived, related in a series of
narratives from different sources and from different points of view,
based largely on the antagonism of two brothers, and pervaded by the
wise spirit of an elderly governess-companion, this novel is so nearly
an epitome of the methods and tricks of Wilkie Collins, that one could
wish it more thoroughly a success.

And here, save for scattered volumes of short stories and one or two
brief and unimportant novels, ends the tale of Collins's books. He is a
writer for tired minds, capable—thanks to his perfect control of the
mechanism of incident—of holding the interest without calling on the
emotional reserves of his reader. His influence on the novel of
sensation has been enormous. It is the least of his due that a
generation brought up on the mystery stories of his disciples should
find time to turn over the principal works of the master himself.


                              _BIOGRAPHY_

The only biography of Wilkie Collins which has yet been published is an

    No half-titles. Preface to Vol. I., dated August 3, 1860. Violet
    embossed cloth, blocked in gold and blind. Pale yellow end-papers.

      NOTES—(i) This book was published in September, 1860. The
      first one-volume edition (1861, magenta cloth blocked in
      gold and blind) contains a special preface.

      (ii) I am uncertain whether or not the earliest copies of
      this novel contained in any one of the three volumes a
      publishers' catalogue. The first editions I have seen show a
      16 pp. catalogue at the end of Vol. III., but dated
      November, 1860, so that they belong clearly to a subsequent
      issue. _The Woman in White_ is a case over which the buyer
      should take great care. A so-called “New Edition” was issued
      in the year of publication and _with binding identical_ to
      that of the first edition, for which reason only the right
      advertisement matter can show that a copy is untampered
      with. I should welcome information tending to establish
      whether a catalogue (and if so where and of what date)
      should properly figure in a “right” copy of the novel.

                             CHARLES READE


If no judgment is here attempted of the work of Charles Reade, it is
because he refuses to be “placed,” in the opinion of the present writer.
At times he is so fine, so resilient, so impressive; at others, the
dullest of pamphleteers, a cramped Meredith in style, a very waxwork
among sensationalists. Fortunately certain aspects of his powerful but
clumsy mind have of late been admirably presented. The “London Mercury”
for June, 1921 (Vol. IV., No. 20), contained an article by E. W. Hornung
which all interested would do well to read. In the matter of biography
proper students may be referred (but without confidence) to:

  CHARLES READE: DRAMATIST, NOVELIST, JOURNALIST. A memoir compiled
    chiefly from his literary remains by CHARLES L. READE and the Rev.
    COMPTON READE. 2 vols. London: Chapman and Hall Ltd., 1887.

This pious work is too rhapsodical to possess more than personal
interest.

  CHARLES READE AS I KNEW HIM. By JOHN COLEMAN. London: Treherne and Co.
    1903.

Reference is made below to the useful list of plays which concludes this
otherwise rather chaotic book.

  *GOLDEN CROWNS: Sunday Stories. By CHARLES READE, D.C.L. Manchester:
    Tubbs and Brooke. 1 vol. 18mo.

      NOTE—This publication was of a kind known as an “18mo
      packet.” It consisted of a number of loose sheets enclosed
      in a paper wrapper, designed either to gum or to tuck in,
      but wholly detached from its contents. Never having seen a
      copy of the packet in question, I cannot do more than
      conjecture that the loose sheets bore each a brief moral
      tale, which a devout parent could administer Sunday by
      Sunday to the deserving young.

  DORA: A Pastoral Poem in Three Acts. With New Scenic Effect and
    Appropriate Music. Founded on Mr. Tennyson's poem and written by
    CHARLES READE. London: Printed by W. Clowes and Sons, Stamford
    Street and Charing Cross. 1 vol. Cr. 8vo (4¾ × 7⅜). Pp. 53 + (3).
    Yellow paper wrappers, printed in black with the single word “Dora”
    enclosed in decorative frame.

      NOTES—(i) This play was reissued about 1872 or 1873 by
      Williams and Strahan, 7 Lawrence Lane, Cheapside, in a
      fifty-page pamphlet measuring 4⅛ × 7⅛ and wrappered in buff
      paper, printed merely with the word “Dora” in black. The
      text shows slight variations from that of the first issue.

      (ii) The date of the first of the above issues is doubtful.
      _Dora_ was written in 1863 or 1864, but evidence is wanting
      to show whether it was then printed, or not until its first
      production in 1867. It was revived in the early nineties.


                                [?1867]

  THE DOUBLE MARRIAGE: A Drama in Five Acts. By AUGUSTE MAQUET and
    CHARLES READE. London: Printed by W. Clowes and Sons, Stamford
    Street and Charing Cross, 1 vol. Cr. 8vo (4¾ × 7½). Pp. (iv) + 80.
    Yellow paper wrappers, printed in black, with play title only
    enclosed in decorative frame. This pamphlet is uniform in style with
    _Dora_.

      NOTE—This play is based on _Le Château Grantier_ by Maquet.
      The date of printing is conjectural, being that of its first
      production. Reade's novel _White Lies_ (see above, p. 161)
      is a fictional version of the same plot.


                                [?1869]

  KATE PEYTON: Or JEALOUSY. 1 vol. Fcap. 8vo (4¼ × 7⅛). Pp. 84. Pink
    paper wrappers, printed with play title only.

      NOTES—(i) This booklet bears no printer's name, date, or
      other mark of identification. The text differs slightly from
      that issued in 1883 and described below.

      (ii) The date is purely conjectural. Coleman mentions no
      play of this title, but speaks of _Griffith Gaunt_ as having
      been produced in 1868 or 1869. The above item being a
      dramatic version of _Griffith Gaunt_, I am inclined to think
      that this is the play referred to, and have accordingly
      dated it as having been printed about the time of the first
      production.


                            [?1872 or 1873]

  IT'S NEVER TOO LATE TO MEND. Drama in Five Acts. By CHARLES READE.
    Author of _Gold_; _Rachel the Reaper_; _Ladies' Battle_; _Nobs and
    Snobs_; _The Lost Husband_; _The Double Marriage_; _Kate Peyton_;
    _Foul Play_; _Put Yourself in His Place_; _The Wandering Heir_;
    _Shilly Shally_; _The Courier of Lyons_; etc. etc. And one of the
    authors of _Masks and Faces_; _Two Loves and a Life_; _The First
    Printer_; _The King's Rival_. London: Printed by Williams and
    Strahan, 7 Lawrence Lane, Cheapside. 1 vol. Fcap. 8vo (4¼ × 7) Pp.
    97 + (1). Buff paper wrappers, printed in black with the play title
    only.

      NOTES—(i) This play was reissued in 1890 in a pamphlet
      printed for private circulation by W. Spearing, 1, Great
      Queen Street, W.C. The booklet measures 5½ × 8½; contains
      pp. 148—of which (1) to (4) are regular prelims., (5) to
      (146) are printed alternately and paged (5) to 76, and (147)
      and (148) are blank—and is bound in grey paper wrappers,
      printed in black. The text of this second version shows
      considerable variation from that of the first, and the play
      is in four acts instead of five.

      (ii) The date at the head of this item is conjectural.
      Reade's first original dramatization of _It's Never Too Late
      to Mend_ was written by 1864 and produced in 1865. Coleman
      speaks in that year of receiving from Laura Seymour a
      “yellow covered book” of the text of the play, and this
      book, if printed, was the real first edition. But I cannot
      prove the existence of a printed text at that date, and
      prefer to give first place to the pamphlet here described,
      although, because of the other plays mentioned on the
      title-page, it cannot be of earlier date than 1872.

      (iii) In July, 1860, a dramatization of Reade's novel had
      been issued in Lacy's Acting Edition. Reade was rightly
      furious at the unauthorized issue of this version, and
      hastened to prepare one of his own. For the benefit of those
      interested I append details of the pirate booklet.


                              [1860-July]

    (3). Advertisements occupy pp. (43) and (44). Salmon-pink paper
    wrappers, printed in black, uniform with the other volumes in
    French's (late Lacy's) Acting Editions, of which this is No. 1609.

      NOTE—This is a revised version of the play originally
      published in 1851 (see above, p. 170).


                                  1878

  THE WELL BORN WORKMAN: Or A MAN OF THE DAY. By CHARLES READE, author
    of _Never Too Late to Mend_, _Foul Play_ etc. London: Printed for

    (4¼ × 6⅞). Pp. 82 + (2). Buff paper wrappers, printed in black, with
    the title and sub-title of the play.


                                  1883

  FOUL PLAY. Drama in a Prologue and Five Acts. By CHARLES READE.
    London. 1883. Printed by J. C. Durant, Clement's House, Clement's
    Inn Passage, Strand, W.C. But not published. 1 vol. Demy 8vo (5½ ×
    8½). Pp. 72. Grey paper wrappers, printed in black as title-page.

      NOTE—This play was written in collaboration with Boucicault
      and produced early in 1868. It was attacked on the ground
      that it was pirated from a French drama: _La Portefeuille
      Rouge_. Reade hotly denied that he had read or even heard of
      this French play, and Coleman considers the denial to have
      been genuine enough. He is, however, less certain that
      Boucicault was not familiar with the supposed French
      original. _Foul Play_, as first acted, was later revived
      under different titles—_The Scuttled Ship_ and _Our Seaman_.
      Perhaps the text described above and bearing Reade's name
      only is a different version from that produced with
      Boucicault. Of the text in collaboration I can trace no
      printed issue.


                                  1883

  KATE PEYTON: Or JEALOUSY: A Drama, in a prologue and Four Acts. By

    published. 1 vol. Small Cr. 8vo (4¾ × 7). Pp. 53 + (3). Grey paper
    wrappers printed in black.

      NOTE—There being no title-page to this pamphlet, the
      lettering given above is that of the wrapper.


                                  1883

  THE COUNTESS AND THE DANCER: Or HIGH LIFE IN VIENNA. A Comedy Drama in
    Four Acts. Altered from a masterpiece of VICTORIEN SARDOU by CHARLES
    READE. London: 1883. 1 vol. Demy 8vo (5½ × 8⅜). Pp. vi + 60. Grey
    paper wrappers, printed in black; wording as title-page.


                                  NOTE

The bibliography of Reade's plays is obscure and confusing. I have
listed in the foregoing pages only those of the printed issue of which I
have found certain evidence. He is known, however, to have written many
more, some at least of which were probably printed privately. Wherefore
it seems desirable here to supply such particulars as can be found of
the writing and acting of Reade's other plays. The facts are taken
mainly from Coleman's book, which contains as an appendix a good list of
titles and dates of production. Unfortunately the book itself is so
confusingly put together that text and appendix are far from
complementary and at times even in conflict.

                       GEORGE JOHN WHYTE-MELVILLE
                               1821-1878




                          G. J. WHYTE-MELVILLE


Although as an authority on matters sporting Whyte-Melville stands
alone, it is yet impossible, with the best will in the world and with
all the respect due to his personal chivalry and courage, to regard him
in the rôle of novelist as anything but absurd.

His books, where they deal with the science and the joys of hunting,
have the vivid appeal that only delighted conviction can give; but as
fiction, as readings of life adequately expressed in English prose, they
are negligible and often ludicrous.

Whyte-Melville, the sportsman, is a figure of dignity and inspiration;
Whyte-Melville, the social novelist, is Ouida in breeches. That the
breeches are of perfect cut may not disguise the conventional swagger of
the legs they cover. The ways trodden by this author in his search for
character and incident are the exclusive ways of Victorian landlordism.
Their pavements are thronged with fair ladies and brave gentlemen, while
in the roadway crowd the lower orders—some mildly criminal, some a
little comic, but the majority joyous in their privilege to serve the
brilliant purpose of their betters. The antics of these humble creatures
are watched with kindly patronage by those to whom wealth and pleasure
are a normal birthright. Conversing among themselves, heartily but with
elegance, the Guardsmen and squirelings of the fashionable clubs find
time to exchange gracious greeting with their poorer neighbours, whose
uncouth speech strikes quaintly pleasant on their cultured ears. An
instruction is given; half a sovereign changes hands; a cap is dutifully
touched. God willed that of His creatures some be rich and others poor;
let the former bear themselves honourably and remember (when not
otherwise engaged) the duties of their station; let the latter be happy
in the lot to which Providence has called them.

But genial condescension to his dependants is not the only or even the
main business of the Whyte-Melville gentleman. His life has two
absorbing interests—horses and ladies. To a point these interests merge.
With identical _expertise_ he takes the points of a fine girl and of a
blood mare. The former in her drawing-room, the latter in her stable,
await in gleaming beauty his appreciative caress. At their point of
ultimate usefulness, however, femininity and horseflesh part company.
The latter is the hero's ally, the former his quarry in the chase; and
while his adventures on horseback are told with the zest and knowledge
of real authority, his exploits in lady-killing have the tedious
unreality of a tale only half imagined and not a quarter lived.

It is for the falseness of his emotional writing that Whyte-Melville
challenges comparison with Ouida. And, the comparison made, one is bound
to concede victory to the latter. Both deal in the passions of the nobly
born; but while the woman has at least the courage of bad taste, the
man, fettered by good form, achieves no taste at all. Whyte-Melville's
novels, like _Hamlet_, are full of quotations. He is the father of
novelette; the wellspring of cliché. His lovely ladies are not women nor
his gallants men: they are the dummies of suburban melodrama,
exquisitely gowned, faultlessly tailored, mouthing the phrases of
drawing-room passionates, but, even as dummies, failing to achieve that
semblance of gilded sin that is their only purpose.

Nevertheless, despite their ineptitude, the books of Whyte-Melville
compel a curious and obscure respect. Respect for what it were hard to
say, for his written word is his own deadliest accuser. Sentences might
be chosen almost at random from the novels of social life that would
prove his possession of every fault possible to a novelist and to a
writer of prose. And yet, through the screen of their fatuity, one has
glimpses of the personality of the author himself—a personality at which
one may make mock, but only with affection. This country gentleman
turned novelist was an upright, guileless creature, hard riding,
generous hearted, as unconscious of his innate snobbery as of his
natural modesty, conventional because unaware of any world or school of
thought beyond the narrow limits of his own. His pictures of England are
as dull and as unreal as the pretty garden scenes in water-colour
produced by county ladies to this day; but both the painter of these
lifeless pictures and the comfortable amateurs responsible for horrid
views of moorland and herbaceous border command a sort of wistful
admiration. There is something so clean and easy and contented in the
mentality from which these books and drawings spring that, if only it
were not so stupid, so impenetrable to variety of idea, its passing
might well be looked on with regret. Whyte-Melville's qualities, like
those of the type he represents, are more obscure than his defects. The
class of country gentleman to which he personally belonged is rapidly
disappearing; when it is gone we shall wonder a little perplexedly why
we miss it. It was so easy to ridicule, so pathetically a target for
mockery and persecution. In our greater wisdom we have shot it to
pieces, riddling its obtuse selfishness, its bland complacency, with the
bullets of reforming zeal. But something fine will have perished with
it, something indefinable but leaving a sense of gap, to remind us that
destruction is never quite the discriminating triumph that iconoclasts
claim for it in advance.

This, then, is one contemporary view of Whyte-Melville's novels, whose
only demonstrable virtue is their sportsmanship. One may quote from
_Market Harborough_, from _Riding Recollections_, even from the social
stories, passages of speed and exhilaration, passages of unaffected
wisdom and perception, descriptive of the hunting that, next to honour,
he loved best of all that life could offer. In opposition may be printed
page after page of stilted rhetoric, mawkish humour, the falsest of
sentiment, the most wanton elaboration of noun and adjective. But after
all quotation is done and a balance struck, there will still remain the
elusive quality that gave character to the class from which the author
came, an essence of breeding and tradition that no phrasing can
crystallize, that vanishes in the moment of its expression. For this
spiritual quality Whyte-Melville is admirable; for his literary faults
he is unreadable. Such, in a nutshell, is the judgment of one reader who
cannot excuse a book stupidity and pretentiousness for the sake of
isolated passages of hunting lore, but seeks to appreciate in the
character of a social generation that is fading fast, a distinction that
to all seeming will fade with it.

There are, however, readers of other kinds, and for their sake and
because among our grandmothers and our aunts the stories of
Whyte-Melville were avidly admired, a summary classification of his
books shall be attempted.

He began as a writer of autobiographies, of the part-fashionable,
part-sporting, part-knockabout kind, the tradition of which came down
from the eighteenth century, through Frederick Marryat, to a dozen
writers of the hard-drinking, riotous forties. _Digby Grand_ (1853) and
_Tilbury Nogo_ (1854) are essentially novels of this type, while in
_Kate Coventry_ (1856) the author merely adapts the recipe to the needs
of a girl heroine. _The Interpreter_ (1858) strikes a note of its own,
for the scenes in the Crimea and in Turkey were drawn from the writer's
experience and give a convincing picture of the period and its
happenings. Apart from them, however, the book is an ordinary
first-person record of the social wanderings of a young Englishman of
family.

Between the second and the third of the books above mentioned had
appeared _General Bounce_ (1855), a transitional novel, not wholly apart
from those that preceded it, but halfway to a place among the stories of
contemporary love-making and sport, of which the author was to produce a
lengthy list. These novels of English society contain much of the most
repellent of Whyte-Melville's work, although many have refreshing
interludes of hunting and scenes on the racecourse or in the stable that
will endear them to specialists in the genre, if they cannot reconcile
others to the artificial tedium of the love stories and the clumsy
contriving of the plots. Here are the titles of the social novels:

                   GENERAL BOUNCE (1855),
                   GOOD FOR NOTHING (1861),
                   THE BROOKES OF BRIDLEMERE (1864),
                   THE WHITE ROSE (1868),
                   M OR N (1869),
                   CONTRABAND (1871),
                   SATANELLA (1872),
                   UNCLE JOHN (1874),
                   ROY'S WIFE (1878),
                   BLACK BUT COMELY (1879).

Next in numerical importance are the costume novels, beloved of an
earlier generation, but to the critical modern reader the poorest of
poor stuff, so compact of Wardour Street, of hollow sentiment, and of
forced, démodé attitude as to be intolerable.

HOLMBY HOUSE (1860)

    (A tale of the Civil War with a strong bias in favour of the
    Cavalier party),

THE QUEEN'S MARIES (1862)

    (A romantic tribute to Mary, Queen of Scots),

THE GLADIATORS (1863)

    (A novel of Rome and Judæa at the time of Christ),

CERISE (1866)

    (An eighteenth-century tale),

SARCHEDON (1871)

    (A novel centring round the figure of Semiramis),

SISTER LOUISE (1876)

    (A novel of seventeenth-century France),

ROSINE (1877)

    (A novel of the French Revolution).

There remain two books of purely sporting significance, and
_Katerfelto_.

_Market Harborough_ (1861), the pride of the Pytchley, is hardly a
novel. It is a string of hunting and horse-dealing episodes into which
Whyte-Melville threw all that he had of science and of enthusiasm.
_Riding Recollections_ (1878) are what their name implies. It is not for
any but the expert to criticize these books, which are held in some
quarters to be essential textbooks to a hunting education. _Katerfelto_
(1875) will also escape comment here, but for a different reason. Among
my childhood memories this Exmoor tale glows adored, uncriticized. How
will it read to-day? To put it to the test frightens me. I dare not open
it.

      typical of the Victorian table book at its most ornate.

      (ii) The author revised and added to the poems in this book
      on several occasions after its original publication.
      Strictly speaking, any new edition which contains even one
      fresh poem may rank as a first edition, and collectors of
      Whyte-Melville, who are also purists, may therefore be
      advised not to pass over any one of the first six or seven
      editions of _Songs and Verses_ without satisfying themselves
      that no fresh matter distinguishes it from its predecessors.

                            [?1879 or 1880]

  THE BONES AT ROTHWELL: A Lecture delivered by the late Captain WHYTE
    MELVILLE, being an account of the remarkable bone cavern beneath
    Rothwell Church. Price 1d. Rothwell, printed by Ed. Chamberlain, 3
    Market Place. (Quotation from Gray's _Elegy_ heads title-page and
    wrapper.) 1 vol. Cr. 8vo. 16 pp. White paper wrappers, printed in
    black. Outside back wrapper occupied by printer's advertisements.

      NOTE—This is the text of a lecture delivered by
      Whyte-Melville on January 3, 1862, to the Moulton Religious
      and Useful Knowledge Society, and printed in the
      “Northampton Mercury” for January 11 of the same year. When
      first the pamphlet above described was issued I cannot be
      certain, but R. B. Wallis, in a booklet published in 1888,
      and entitled _All About the Rothwell Bones_, speaks of the
      lecture as obtainable in pamphlet form from Chamberlan of
      Rothwell. Certainly, therefore, the publication predates
      1888, and I have ventured above on the date of the year
      following Whyte-Melville's death because it seems possible
      that the lecture was first issued in pamphlet form to
      combine the interest in the Rothwell Bones with that likely
      to be created in Whyte-Melville by his decease. The
      clumsiness with which Whyte-Melville is spoken of as “the
      late,” but at the same time given the rank of “Captain”
      instead of that of “Major,” implies a hasty reprint from the
      file of the “Northampton Mercury,” by someone aware of his
      death but careless of the military rank to which he finally
      attained.

      The colour of the paper wrapper varies with different
      issues. In addition to a white copy, as above described, I
      have seen one in a pale yellow cover.

                            HERMAN MELVILLE
                               1819-1891




                            HERMAN MELVILLE


At intervals during the last forty years, Herman Melville has been
discovered by intellectuals, belauded, a little read, and once more
forgotten. It is typical of the man and of his perverse withdrawal from
the lettered world, that even before his death he was the subject of
spasmodic battues by appreciative readers, who sought to startle into
activity their idol's reputation by methods suited to the enlivenment of
an author long dead and hidden by the undergrowth of time.

The latest and the most thorough stimulation to which the repute of
Melville has been subjected is now at full stretch. Whatever its
critical shortcomings, this concerted attempt to write a new name on the
roll of nineteenth-century genius bids fair to achieve one important
triumph—the immortalization of _Moby Dick_ and, consequentially, of the
man who wrote it.

A very minor result of the same Melville boom is his inclusion in this
book. Save in the matter of date, he has little in common with the other
writers here treated. They are of Victorianism Victorian; he, if he
belongs to any period or to any genealogy, is of the ageless, race-less
family of the lonely giants. That his fellows between these covers are
all lesser novelists than he, I am unprepared to admit. Trollope excels
him in humour, wisdom and depth of understanding; he must rank, as
master of technique, below all save Whyte-Melville and perhaps Disraeli.
But he has a quality of grandeur, a majesty of isolation that they lack,
and his very inchoate bitterness of spirit transcends by its
datelessness their well-rounded friendliness and their complacent wit.

If that were not enough, he differs from them also in the very texture
and subject of his work. His mysticism, for all its yearning and its
gloom, is of a spiritual quality far rarer than that of their
materialism, for all its vivacity and its aspiration. Between him and
Reade is a certain soul resemblance, but the advantage in this is
Melville's. He directly influenced the Englishman,[4] and beside his
remote immensity Reade, even at his most massive and his most
contentious, seems but a dwarf, roaring disgruntlement against the walls
of Grub Street.

Footnote 4:

  There is in existence the copy of _Moby Dick_ in which Reade made
  extensive notes and excisions, maybe with the idea of issuing an
  abbreviated version. Readers of _Love Me Little, Love Me Long_ will
  immediately detect the influence of Melville's great book on the
  whaling narrative related by Frank Dodd to Mr. Fountain and to his
  lovely niece.

Melville's books are the strange mirror of a strange life. The young
writer, famous at thirty, who yet lives out a diminuendo of appreciation
to an old age of disappointed poverty, is no unfamiliar figure. One
thinks immediately of William Harrison Ainsworth, from the foppish
eminence of his early twenties to the last sad years in a Tonbridge
villa, when he laboured at the regular production of three-volume
fiction—one novel a year at seventy-five pounds the time—alone amid the
memories of vanished splendour. But the man who as a youth wins
reputation in letters and passes, of deliberate purpose, maturity and
age in other, non-literary, pursuits is a scarcer type, of which
Melville is an unusual example.

Born in 1819, he published _Typee_ at the age of twenty-seven, _Moby
Dick_ five years later, and _The Piazza Tales_ in 1856. From then until
his death, in 1891, he wrote little, and, to the even greater detriment
of his fame, withdrew entirely from the society of writers, hiding his
name and his very existence behind the screen of an obstinate reserve.

I have no intention here either of summarizing the life or of passing
judgment on the works of Herman Melville. The former is related in
detail by Professor Raymond Weaver, whose large biography is of so
recent date that any shorter presentment of the facts must merely be a
précis of the information therein contained. The respective merits of
the outstanding books are already (and will remain for long enough) the
sport of literary publicists, to whose views and counter-views I refer
the curious. One feature, nevertheless, of contemporary opinion
challenges to protest my amateur temerity. Apart from _Moby Dick_, the
neo-Melvillian has little beyond patronizing approval for the books of
his hero; _Typee_ (1846) and _Omoo_ (1847) are interesting records of
travel, remarkable mainly for the early date of their appearance and as
forerunners of the South Sea School in letters and in painting. _Mardi_
(1849), _Redburn_ (1849), and _White Jacket_ (1850) claim respect as
autobiography and for passages that reveal their author's genius
struggling toward a more complete expression. These are the rising steps
to the crowning summit of Melville's work. There, unique and peerless,
stands _Moby Dick_; beyond it the terraces fall away again, and even
more steeply than they rose.

Is this opinion a just one? I am a little uncertain. With no desire to
denigrate _Moby Dick_ or to deny it the first place in _importance_
among Melville's books, I would venture that his genius is more
perfectly and skilfully revealed in a volume of stories belonging to the
so-called decadence. _The Piazza Tales_ are liable to be dismissed by
the critic of to-day with kindly condescension as “the best of the later
work,” a judgment as misleading as it is easily explained. In some
degree the worship of _Moby Dick_ and the comparative neglect of the
other work are inevitable corollaries to the Melville boom at its
present stage. During the first period of any new æsthetic wonder, the
peculiar transcends the normal in the imagination of disciples. Let the
case of Melville be paralleled with that of Tintoretto's pupil, Greco.
When first set in the revival of interest in this painter's work, he was
most admired when most bizarre. He won favour for the contrast he
presented to his immediate forerunners and his contemporaries. The name
of Greco stood for certain mannerisms in colour and composition, and,
the more a Greco picture revealed those mannerisms, the better a Greco
it was judged to be. Already, from the hand of time, this formula of
appreciation is suffering adjustment, but Melville is to-day precisely
at the point where yesterday Greco stood. Like the master of Toledo, he
has peculiar and noticeable tricks of matter and of style. Because _Moby
Dick_ is of these tricks more redolent than the author's other books, it
tickles the palate of contemporary enthusiasm more thoroughly than do
they.

Such preference is by its very nature tenacious. _Moby Dick_, for all
that it is unmistakably Melville, is far from flawless. What if Melville
recognized its weaknesses? What if he deplored those very
characteristics that are to-day lauded as his priceless individuality
and chief claim to fame? With all its vastness and its wonder, the epic
story of Ahab and the great white whale displays the faults of its
author as strikingly as it reveals his talents. In years to come, when
the glamour of oddity has paled a little, it will be admitted that the
book labours under a sad weight of intolerable prolixity. Nor is this
prolixity implicit in the greatness of Melville's writing. This is
proved by the two chief stories in _The Piazza Tales_. _Benito Cereno_
and _The Encatadas_ hold in the small compass of their beauty the
essence of their author's supreme artistry. They are profound and lovely
and tenderly robust, but they are never tedious and never wilful. Surely
it were generous to admit that Melville sought to improve on _Moby Dick_
and that, in the matter of technical control, he succeeded? These two
stories cannot as literary achievement compare with their vast and
teeming predecessor. That is natural. But they may not be ignored as the
last glimmer of a dying lamp. They mark the highest technical level of
their author's work, and, had not within a year or two of their
appearance the darkness of self-distrust descended on him, might well
have proved a revelation of something yet to come from the brain of
Herman Melville, something destined—but for the treacherous inhibition
of human frailty—to excel in power everything to which that brain had
previously given birth.

    This long and careful book is based on the papers and information of

    of Melville's life and ideas.


                                 _NOTE_

Collectors should observe the fact that it was the custom of American
publishers in the fifties and sixties to bind one edition in cloths of
various colours for the purposes of window display. Consequently
Melville's first American editions are met with in a variety of
colourings which, in the matter of date of issue, rank equally.

      (ii) I have seen a copy of this edition bearing on the case
      the name of T. C. Newby as publisher, but with the Bentley

      frequently bought sheets of books that had not sold when
      originally published, and issued them at a cheaper price
      wholly or partially over his imprint.

    Bros., Publishers, 82 Cliff Street. 1849. 1 vol. Cr. 8vo (4⅞ × 7½).
    Pp. (420). The numbering of pages is very erratic. Pp. (1)-(6) are
    blank and unpaged; p. (7) is title-page; p. (8) bears note of the
    book's official registration; p. (9) bears dedication; p. (10) is
    blank; pp. (11)-(17) are occupied by List of Contents paged (v)-xi;
    p. (12) is blank; pp. (13) to 390 are so paged; pp. (391)-(394) are
    unpaged and occupied by advertisements of other works by Melville;
    pp. (395)-(406) form a publishers' list, dated October, 1849, and
    paged (1) to 14; pp. (407) and (408) are occupied by publishers'
    advertisements, undated, but paged (1) and 2; pp. (409)-(412) are
    blank; pp. (413) and (414) are pasted down to inside back end-paper.
    No printed half-title. Purple-brown cloth, gilt, blocked in blind.
    Yellow end-papers.

      NOTE—Copies of the first edition are found with fewer
      advertisement pages at the end. These may well, in view of
      the irregular nature of American bookmaking at that period,
      be contemporary in issue with those more extensively
      furnished, but the collector will naturally prefer a copy as
      complete as possible.

  ISRAEL POTTER: HIS FIFTY YEARS OF EXILE. By HERMAN MELVILLE, author of

                                  1856

  THE PIAZZA TALES. By HERMAN MELVILLE, author of _Typee_, _Omoo_, etc.
    etc. New York: Dix and Edwards, 321 Broadway. London: Sampson Low,
    Son and Co. 1856. 1 vol. Cr. 8vo (4¾ × 7⅛). Pp. (vi) + 431 + (11).
    No printed half-title. Publishers' advertisements, unpaged and
    undated, occupy pp. (433)-(439). Purple-brown cloth, blocked in gold
    and blind. Grey-blue end-papers.

      _Contents_: The Piazza—Bartleby—Benito Cereno—The
      Lightning-Rod Man—The Encantadas; or Enchanted Islands—The
      Bell-Tower.

      NOTES—(i) This book was published in May or June, 1856.

      (ii) It is doubtful whether copies of this book were ever
      actually issued in England, despite the fact that Sampson
      Low and Co. advertised the book at 9s. in June, 1856. At the
      most, copies may exist with an English cancel title, but
      even this is improbable in view of the joint imprint on the
      New York edition. It will be noted that when previously Low
      imported Melville sheets (_cf._ _Pierre_, 1852) they
      inserted their own title-page and bound the book differently
      for English issue, but in that case their name was not
      printed on the American edition.

      (iii) Copies of the first American edition exist, with pale
      yellow end-papers. These are thinner in quality than the
      grey-blue ones above mentioned, and not chalk surfaced to
      the extent usual with American tinted papers of the period.
      Indeed, they have more the appearance of English than of
      American end-papers, but it is difficult to believe that
      Sampson Low and Co. could have imported sheets and cases
      from America, merely carrying out in this country the
      process of binding.

                      II.—BOOKS PARTIALLY WRITTEN
                           BY HERMAN MELVILLE

There are only two items that it is possible to list under this heading,
and to each one of them Melville's contribution is so slight as to make
unnecessary their detailed collation. P. 30 of the _Memorial to James
Fenimore Cooper_, published in one volume by Putnam, New York, in 1852,
bears a letter from Melville in praise of Cooper addressed to the
Committee organizing the Cooper celebration. Pp. 399 and 400 of _The
History of Pittsfield, Massachusetts from 1800 to 1876_, by J. E. A.
Smith, and published in Springfield by C. W. Bryan and Co., 1876, bear
an account of Major Thomas Melville written by Herman Melville, but not
nominally attributed to him.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
