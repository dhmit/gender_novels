TOM SAWYER ABROAD

By Mark Twain




CHAPTER I. TOM SEEKS NEW ADVENTURES

DO you reckon Tom Sawyer was satisfied after all them adventures? I mean
the adventures we had down the river, and the time we set the darky Jim
free and Tom got shot in the leg. No, he wasn't. It only just p'isoned
him for more. That was all the effect it had. You see, when we three
came back up the river in glory, as you may say, from that long travel,
and the village received us with a torchlight procession and speeches,
and everybody hurrah'd and shouted, it made us heroes, and that was what
Tom Sawyer had always been hankering to be.

For a while he WAS satisfied. Everybody made much of him, and he tilted
up his nose and stepped around the town as though he owned it. Some
called him Tom Sawyer the Traveler, and that just swelled him up fit to
bust. You see he laid over me and Jim considerable, because we only went
down the river on a raft and came back by the steamboat, but Tom went
by the steamboat both ways. The boys envied me and Jim a good deal, but
land! they just knuckled to the dirt before TOM.

Well, I don't know; maybe he might have been satisfied if it hadn't been
for old Nat Parsons, which was postmaster, and powerful long and slim,
and kind o' good-hearted and silly, and bald-headed, on account of his
age, and about the talkiest old cretur I ever see. For as much as thirty
years he'd been the only man in the village that had a reputation--I
mean a reputation for being a traveler, and of course he was mortal
proud of it, and it was reckoned that in the course of that thirty years
he had told about that journey over a million times and enjoyed it every
time. And now comes along a boy not quite fifteen, and sets everybody
admiring and gawking over HIS travels, and it just give the poor old
man the high strikes. It made him sick to listen to Tom, and to hear the
people say “My land!” “Did you ever!” “My goodness sakes alive!” and
all such things; but he couldn't pull away from it, any more than a fly
that's got its hind leg fast in the molasses. And always when Tom come
to a rest, the poor old cretur would chip in on HIS same old travels
and work them for all they were worth; but they were pretty faded, and
didn't go for much, and it was pitiful to see. And then Tom would take
another innings, and then the old man again--and so on, and so on, for
an hour and more, each trying to beat out the other.

You see, Parsons' travels happened like this: When he first got to
be postmaster and was green in the business, there come a letter
for somebody he didn't know, and there wasn't any such person in the
village. Well, he didn't know what to do, nor how to act, and there the
letter stayed and stayed, week in and week out, till the bare sight of
it gave him a conniption. The postage wasn't paid on it, and that was
another thing to worry about. There wasn't any way to collect that ten
cents, and he reckon'd the gov'ment would hold him responsible for it
and maybe turn him out besides, when they found he hadn't collected it.
Well, at last he couldn't stand it any longer. He couldn't sleep nights,
he couldn't eat, he was thinned down to a shadder, yet he da'sn't ask
anybody's advice, for the very person he asked for advice might go back
on him and let the gov'ment know about the letter. He had the letter
buried under the floor, but that did no good; if he happened to see
a person standing over the place it'd give him the cold shivers, and
loaded him up with suspicions, and he would sit up that night till the
town was still and dark, and then he would sneak there and get it out
and bury it in another place. Of course, people got to avoiding him and
shaking their heads and whispering, because, the way he was looking and
acting, they judged he had killed somebody or done something terrible,
they didn't know what, and if he had been a stranger they would've
lynched him.

Well, as I was saying, it got so he couldn't stand it any longer; so
he made up his mind to pull out for Washington, and just go to the
President of the United States and make a clean breast of the whole
thing, not keeping back an atom, and then fetch the letter out and lay
it before the whole gov'ment, and say, “Now, there she is--do with me
what you're a mind to; though as heaven is my judge I am an innocent man
and not deserving of the full penalties of the law and leaving behind
me a family that must starve and yet hadn't had a thing to do with it,
which is the whole truth and I can swear to it.”

So he did it. He had a little wee bit of steamboating, and some
stage-coaching, but all the rest of the way was horseback, and it took
him three weeks to get to Washington. He saw lots of land and lots of
villages and four cities. He was gone 'most eight weeks, and there never
was such a proud man in the village as he when he got back. His travels
made him the greatest man in all that region, and the most talked about;
and people come from as much as thirty miles back in the country, and
from over in the Illinois bottoms, too, just to look at him--and there
they'd stand and gawk, and he'd gabble. You never see anything like it.

Well, there wasn't any way now to settle which was the greatest
traveler; some said it was Nat, some said it was Tom. Everybody allowed
that Nat had seen the most longitude, but they had to give in that
whatever Tom was short in longitude he had made up in latitude and
climate. It was about a stand-off; so both of them had to whoop up their
dangerous adventures, and try to get ahead THAT way. That bullet-wound
in Tom's leg was a tough thing for Nat Parsons to buck against, but he
bucked the best he could; and at a disadvantage, too, for Tom didn't set
still as he'd orter done, to be fair, but always got up and sauntered
around and worked his limp while Nat was painting up the adventure that
HE had in Washington; for Tom never let go that limp when his leg got
well, but practiced it nights at home, and kept it good as new right
along.

Nat's adventure was like this; I don't know how true it is; maybe he got
it out of a paper, or somewhere, but I will say this for him, that he
DID know how to tell it. He could make anybody's flesh crawl, and he'd
turn pale and hold his breath when he told it, and sometimes women and
girls got so faint they couldn't stick it out. Well, it was this way, as
near as I can remember:

He come a-loping into Washington, and put up his horse and shoved out to
the President's house with his letter, and they told him the President
was up to the Capitol, and just going to start for Philadelphia--not a
minute to lose if he wanted to catch him. Nat 'most dropped, it made him
so sick. His horse was put up, and he didn't know what to do. But just
then along comes a darky driving an old ramshackly hack, and he see his
chance. He rushes out and shouts: “A half a dollar if you git me to
the Capitol in half an hour, and a quarter extra if you do it in twenty
minutes!”

“Done!” says the darky.

Nat he jumped in and slammed the door, and away they went a-ripping and
a-tearing over the roughest road a body ever see, and the racket of it
was something awful. Nat passed his arms through the loops and hung on
for life and death, but pretty soon the hack hit a rock and flew up in
the air, and the bottom fell out, and when it come down Nat's feet was
on the ground, and he see he was in the most desperate danger if he
couldn't keep up with the hack. He was horrible scared, but he laid into
his work for all he was worth, and hung tight to the arm-loops and made
his legs fairly fly. He yelled and shouted to the driver to stop, and
so did the crowds along the street, for they could see his legs spinning
along under the coach, and his head and shoulders bobbing inside through
the windows, and he was in awful danger; but the more they all shouted
the more the nigger whooped and yelled and lashed the horses and
shouted, “Don't you fret, I'se gwine to git you dah in time, boss; I's
gwine to do it, sho'!” for you see he thought they were all hurrying
him up, and, of course, he couldn't hear anything for the racket he was
making. And so they went ripping along, and everybody just petrified
to see it; and when they got to the Capitol at last it was the quickest
trip that ever was made, and everybody said so. The horses laid down,
and Nat dropped, all tuckered out, and he was all dust and rags
and barefooted; but he was in time and just in time, and caught the
President and give him the letter, and everything was all right, and the
President give him a free pardon on the spot, and Nat give the nigger
two extra quarters instead of one, because he could see that if he
hadn't had the hack he wouldn't'a' got there in time, nor anywhere near
it.

It WAS a powerful good adventure, and Tom Sawyer had to work his
bullet-wound mighty lively to hold his own against it.

Well, by and by Tom's glory got to paling down gradu'ly, on account
of other things turning up for the people to talk about--first a
horse-race, and on top of that a house afire, and on top of that the
circus, and on top of that the eclipse; and that started a revival, same
as it always does, and by that time there wasn't any more talk about
Tom, so to speak, and you never see a person so sick and disgusted.

Pretty soon he got to worrying and fretting right along day in and day
out, and when I asked him what WAS he in such a state about, he said
it 'most broke his heart to think how time was slipping away, and him
getting older and older, and no wars breaking out and no way of making
a name for himself that he could see. Now that is the way boys is always
thinking, but he was the first one I ever heard come out and say it.

So then he set to work to get up a plan to make him celebrated; and
pretty soon he struck it, and offered to take me and Jim in. Tom Sawyer
was always free and generous that way. There's a-plenty of boys that's
mighty good and friendly when YOU'VE got a good thing, but when a good
thing happens to come their way they don't say a word to you, and try to
hog it all. That warn't ever Tom Sawyer's way, I can say that for him.
There's plenty of boys that will come hankering and groveling around you
when you've got an apple and beg the core off of you; but when they've
got one, and you beg for the core and remind them how you give them
a core one time, they say thank you 'most to death, but there ain't
a-going to be no core. But I notice they always git come up with; all
you got to do is to wait.

Well, we went out in the woods on the hill, and Tom told us what it was.
It was a crusade.

“What's a crusade?” I says.

He looked scornful, the way he's always done when he was ashamed of a
person, and says:

“Huck Finn, do you mean to tell me you don't know what a crusade is?”

“No,” says I, “I don't. And I don't care to, nuther. I've lived till now
and done without it, and had my health, too. But as soon as you tell me,
I'll know, and that's soon enough. I don't see any use in finding out
things and clogging up my head with them when I mayn't ever have any
occasion to use 'em. There was Lance Williams, he learned how to talk
Choctaw here till one come and dug his grave for him. Now, then, what's
a crusade? But I can tell you one thing before you begin; if it's a
patent-right, there's no money in it. Bill Thompson he--”

“Patent-right!” says he. “I never see such an idiot. Why, a crusade is a
kind of war.”

I thought he must be losing his mind. But no, he was in real earnest,
and went right on, perfectly ca'm.

“A crusade is a war to recover the Holy Land from the paynim.”

“Which Holy Land?”

“Why, the Holy Land--there ain't but one.”

“What do we want of it?”

“Why, can't you understand? It's in the hands of the paynim, and it's
our duty to take it away from them.”

“How did we come to let them git hold of it?”

“We didn't come to let them git hold of it. They always had it.”

“Why, Tom, then it must belong to them, don't it?”

“Why of course it does. Who said it didn't?”

I studied over it, but couldn't seem to git at the right of it, no way.
I says:

“It's too many for me, Tom Sawyer. If I had a farm and it was mine, and
another person wanted it, would it be right for him to--”

“Oh, shucks! you don't know enough to come in when it rains, Huck Finn.
It ain't a farm, it's entirely different. You see, it's like this. They
own the land, just the mere land, and that's all they DO own; but it
was our folks, our Jews and Christians, that made it holy, and so they
haven't any business to be there defiling it. It's a shame, and we ought
not to stand it a minute. We ought to march against them and take it
away from them.”

“Why, it does seem to me it's the most mixed-up thing I ever see! Now,
if I had a farm and another person--”

“Don't I tell you it hasn't got anything to do with farming? Farming is
business, just common low-down business: that's all it is, it's all
you can say for it; but this is higher, this is religious, and totally
different.”

“Religious to go and take the land away from people that owns it?”

“Certainly; it's always been considered so.”

Jim he shook his head, and says:

“Mars Tom, I reckon dey's a mistake about it somers--dey mos' sholy is.
I's religious myself, en I knows plenty religious people, but I hain't
run across none dat acts like dat.”

It made Tom hot, and he says:

“Well, it's enough to make a body sick, such mullet-headed ignorance! If
either of you'd read anything about history, you'd know that Richard Cur
de Loon, and the Pope, and Godfrey de Bulleyn, and lots more of the most
noble-hearted and pious people in the world, hacked and hammered at the
paynims for more than two hundred years trying to take their land away
from them, and swum neck-deep in blood the whole time--and yet here's
a couple of sap-headed country yahoos out in the backwoods of Missouri
setting themselves up to know more about the rights and wrongs of it
than they did! Talk about cheek!”

Well, of course, that put a more different light on it, and me and
Jim felt pretty cheap and ignorant, and wished we hadn't been quite so
chipper. I couldn't say nothing, and Jim he couldn't for a while; then
he says:

“Well, den, I reckon it's all right; beca'se ef dey didn't know, dey
ain't no use for po' ignorant folks like us to be trying to know; en so,
ef it's our duty, we got to go en tackle it en do de bes' we can. Same
time, I feel as sorry for dem paynims as Mars Tom. De hard part gwine
to be to kill folks dat a body hain't been 'quainted wid and dat hain't
done him no harm. Dat's it, you see. Ef we wuz to go 'mongst 'em, jist
we three, en say we's hungry, en ast 'em for a bite to eat, why, maybe
dey's jist like yuther people. Don't you reckon dey is? Why, DEY'D give
it, I know dey would, en den--”

“Then what?”

“Well, Mars Tom, my idea is like dis. It ain't no use, we CAN'T kill
dem po' strangers dat ain't doin' us no harm, till we've had practice--I
knows it perfectly well, Mars Tom--'deed I knows it perfectly well. But
ef we takes a' axe or two, jist you en me en Huck, en slips acrost de
river to-night arter de moon's gone down, en kills dat sick fam'ly dat's
over on the Sny, en burns dey house down, en--”

“Oh, you make me tired!” says Tom. “I don't want to argue any more with
people like you and Huck Finn, that's always wandering from the subject,
and ain't got any more sense than to try to reason out a thing that's
pure theology by the laws that protect real estate!”

Now that's just where Tom Sawyer warn't fair. Jim didn't mean no harm,
and I didn't mean no harm. We knowed well enough that he was right and
we was wrong, and all we was after was to get at the HOW of it, and
that was all; and the only reason he couldn't explain it so we could
understand it was because we was ignorant--yes, and pretty dull, too, I
ain't denying that; but, land! that ain't no crime, I should think.

But he wouldn't hear no more about it--just said if we had tackled the
thing in the proper spirit, he would 'a' raised a couple of thousand
knights and put them in steel armor from head to heel, and made me a
lieutenant and Jim a sutler, and took the command himself and brushed
the whole paynim outfit into the sea like flies and come back across the
world in a glory like sunset. But he said we didn't know enough to take
the chance when we had it, and he wouldn't ever offer it again. And he
didn't. When he once got set, you couldn't budge him.

But I didn't care much. I am peaceable, and don't get up rows with
people that ain't doing nothing to me. I allowed if the paynim was
satisfied I was, and we would let it stand at that.

Now Tom he got all that notion out of Walter Scott's book, which he was
always reading. And it WAS a wild notion, because in my opinion he never
could've raised the men, and if he did, as like as not he would've got
licked. I took the book and read all about it, and as near as I could
make it out, most of the folks that shook farming to go crusading had a
mighty rocky time of it.



CHAPTER II. THE BALLOON ASCENSION

WELL, Tom got up one thing after another, but they all had tender spots
about 'em somewheres, and he had to shove 'em aside. So at last he was
about in despair. Then the St. Louis papers begun to talk a good deal
about the balloon that was going to sail to Europe, and Tom sort of
thought he wanted to go down and see what it looked like, but couldn't
make up his mind. But the papers went on talking, and so he allowed
that maybe if he didn't go he mightn't ever have another chance to see
a balloon; and next, he found out that Nat Parsons was going down to see
it, and that decided him, of course. He wasn't going to have Nat Parsons
coming back bragging about seeing the balloon, and him having to listen
to it and keep quiet. So he wanted me and Jim to go too, and we went.

It was a noble big balloon, and had wings and fans and all sorts of
things, and wasn't like any balloon you see in pictures. It was away out
toward the edge of town, in a vacant lot, corner of Twelfth street; and
there was a big crowd around it, making fun of it, and making fun of the
man,--a lean pale feller with that soft kind of moonlight in his eyes,
you know,--and they kept saying it wouldn't go. It made him hot to hear
them, and he would turn on them and shake his fist and say they was
animals and blind, but some day they would find they had stood face to
face with one of the men that lifts up nations and makes civilizations,
and was too dull to know it; and right here on this spot their own
children and grandchildren would build a monument to him that would
outlast a thousand years, but his name would outlast the monument. And
then the crowd would burst out in a laugh again, and yell at him, and
ask him what was his name before he was married, and what he would take
to not do it, and what was his sister's cat's grandmother's name, and
all the things that a crowd says when they've got hold of a feller that
they see they can plague. Well, some things they said WAS funny,--yes,
and mighty witty too, I ain't denying that,--but all the same it warn't
fair nor brave, all them people pitching on one, and they so glib and
sharp, and him without any gift of talk to answer back with. But, good
land! what did he want to sass back for? You see, it couldn't do him no
good, and it was just nuts for them. They HAD him, you know. But that
was his way. I reckon he couldn't help it; he was made so, I judge. He
was a good enough sort of cretur, and hadn't no harm in him, and was
just a genius, as the papers said, which wasn't his fault. We can't all
be sound: we've got to be the way we're made. As near as I can make out,
geniuses think they know it all, and so they won't take people's advice,
but always go their own way, which makes everybody forsake them and
despise them, and that is perfectly natural. If they was humbler, and
listened and tried to learn, it would be better for them.

The part the professor was in was like a boat, and was big and roomy,
and had water-tight lockers around the inside to keep all sorts of
things in, and a body could sit on them, and make beds on them, too.
We went aboard, and there was twenty people there, snooping around
and examining, and old Nat Parsons was there, too. The professor kept
fussing around getting ready, and the people went ashore, drifting out
one at a time, and old Nat he was the last. Of course it wouldn't do to
let him go out behind US. We mustn't budge till he was gone, so we could
be last ourselves.

But he was gone now, so it was time for us to follow. I heard a big
shout, and turned around--the city was dropping from under us like a
shot! It made me sick all through, I was so scared. Jim turned gray and
couldn't say a word, and Tom didn't say nothing, but looked excited. The
city went on dropping down, and down, and down; but we didn't seem to be
doing nothing but just hang in the air and stand still. The houses got
smaller and smaller, and the city pulled itself together, closer
and closer, and the men and wagons got to looking like ants and bugs
crawling around, and the streets like threads and cracks; and then it
all kind of melted together, and there wasn't any city any more it was
only a big scar on the earth, and it seemed to me a body could see up
the river and down the river about a thousand miles, though of course it
wasn't so much. By and by the earth was a ball--just a round ball, of
a dull color, with shiny stripes wriggling and winding around over it,
which was rivers. The Widder Douglas always told me the earth was round
like a ball, but I never took any stock in a lot of them superstitions
o' hers, and of course I paid no attention to that one, because I could
see myself that the world was the shape of a plate, and flat. I used
to go up on the hill, and take a look around and prove it for myself,
because I reckon the best way to get a sure thing on a fact is to go and
examine for yourself, and not take anybody's say-so. But I had to give
in now that the widder was right. That is, she was right as to the rest
of the world, but she warn't right about the part our village is in;
that part is the shape of a plate, and flat, I take my oath!

The professor had been quiet all this time, as if he was asleep; but he
broke loose now, and he was mighty bitter. He says something like this:

“Idiots! They said it wouldn't go; and they wanted to examine it, and
spy around and get the secret of it out of me. But I beat them. Nobody
knows the secret but me. Nobody knows what makes it move but me; and
it's a new power--a new power, and a thousand times the strongest in the
earth! Steam's foolishness to it! They said I couldn't go to Europe. To
Europe! Why, there's power aboard to last five years, and feed for three
months. They are fools! What do they know about it? Yes, and they said
my air-ship was flimsy. Why, she's good for fifty years! I can sail the
skies all my life if I want to, and steer where I please, though they
laughed at that, and said I couldn't. Couldn't steer! Come here, boy;
we'll see. You press these buttons as I tell you.”

He made Tom steer the ship all about and every which way, and learnt him
the whole thing in nearly no time; and Tom said it was perfectly easy.
He made him fetch the ship down 'most to the earth, and had him spin her
along so close to the Illinois prairies that a body could talk to the
farmers, and hear everything they said perfectly plain; and he flung out
printed bills to them that told about the balloon, and said it was going
to Europe. Tom got so he could steer straight for a tree till he got
nearly to it, and then dart up and skin right along over the top of it.
Yes, and he showed Tom how to land her; and he done it first-rate, too,
and set her down in the prairies as soft as wool. But the minute we
started to skip out the professor says, “No, you don't!” and shot her up
in the air again. It was awful. I begun to beg, and so did Jim; but it
only give his temper a rise, and he begun to rage around and look wild
out of his eyes, and I was scared of him.

Well, then he got on to his troubles again, and mourned and grumbled
about the way he was treated, and couldn't seem to git over it, and
especially people's saying his ship was flimsy. He scoffed at that, and
at their saying she warn't simple and would be always getting out of
order. Get out of order! That graveled him; he said that she couldn't
any more get out of order than the solar sister.

He got worse and worse, and I never see a person take on so. It give
me the cold shivers to see him, and so it did Jim. By and by he got to
yelling and screaming, and then he swore the world shouldn't ever have
his secret at all now, it had treated him so mean. He said he would sail
his balloon around the globe just to show what he could do, and then he
would sink it in the sea, and sink us all along with it, too. Well, it
was the awfulest fix to be in, and here was night coming on!

He give us something to eat, and made us go to the other end of the
boat, and he laid down on a locker, where he could boss all the works,
and put his old pepper-box revolver under his head, and said if anybody
come fooling around there trying to land her, he would kill him.

We set scrunched up together, and thought considerable, but didn't say
much--only just a word once in a while when a body had to say something
or bust, we was so scared and worried. The night dragged along slow and
lonesome. We was pretty low down, and the moonshine made everything soft
and pretty, and the farmhouses looked snug and homeful, and we could
hear the farm sounds, and wished we could be down there; but, laws! we
just slipped along over them like a ghost, and never left a track.

Away in the night, when all the sounds was late sounds, and the air had
a late feel, and a late smell, too--about a two-o'clock feel, as near as
I could make out--Tom said the professor was so quiet this time he must
be asleep, and we'd better--

“Better what?” I says in a whisper, and feeling sick all over, because I
knowed what he was thinking about.

“Better slip back there and tie him, and land the ship,” he says.

I says: “No, sir! Don' you budge, Tom Sawyer.”

And Jim--well, Jim was kind o' gasping, he was so scared. He says:

“Oh, Mars Tom, DON'T! Ef you teches him, we's gone--we's gone sho'!
I ain't gwine anear him, not for nothin' in dis worl'. Mars Tom, he's
plumb crazy.”

Tom whispers and says--“That's WHY we've got to do something. If
he wasn't crazy I wouldn't give shucks to be anywhere but here; you
couldn't hire me to get out--now that I've got used to this balloon and
over the scare of being cut loose from the solid ground--if he was in
his right mind. But it's no good politics, sailing around like this with
a person that's out of his head, and says he's going round the world
and then drown us all. We've GOT to do something, I tell you, and do it
before he wakes up, too, or we mayn't ever get another chance. Come!”

But it made us turn cold and creepy just to think of it, and we said we
wouldn't budge. So Tom was for slipping back there by himself to see if
he couldn't get at the steering-gear and land the ship. We begged and
begged him not to, but it warn't no use; so he got down on his hands and
knees, and begun to crawl an inch at a time, we a-holding our breath and
watching. After he got to the middle of the boat he crept slower than
ever, and it did seem like years to me. But at last we see him get to
the professor's head, and sort of raise up soft and look a good spell
in his face and listen. Then we see him begin to inch along again toward
the professor's feet where the steering-buttons was. Well, he got there
all safe, and was reaching slow and steady toward the buttons, but he
knocked down something that made a noise, and we see him slump down flat
an' soft in the bottom, and lay still. The professor stirred, and says,
“What's that?” But everybody kept dead still and quiet, and he begun to
mutter and mumble and nestle, like a person that's going to wake up, and
I thought I was going to die, I was so worried and scared.

Then a cloud slid over the moon, and I 'most cried, I was so glad. She
buried herself deeper and deeper into the cloud, and it got so dark we
couldn't see Tom. Then it began to sprinkle rain, and we could hear the
professor fussing at his ropes and things and abusing the weather. We
was afraid every minute he would touch Tom, and then we would be goners,
and no help; but Tom was already on his way back, and when we felt his
hands on our knees my breath stopped sudden, and my heart fell down
'mongst my other works, because I couldn't tell in the dark but it might
be the professor! which I thought it WAS.

Dear! I was so glad to have him back that I was just as near happy as a
person could be that was up in the air that way with a deranged man.
You can't land a balloon in the dark, and so I hoped it would keep on
raining, for I didn't want Tom to go meddling any more and make us so
awful uncomfortable. Well, I got my wish. It drizzled and drizzled along
the rest of the night, which wasn't long, though it did seem so; and
at daybreak it cleared, and the world looked mighty soft and gray and
pretty, and the forests and fields so good to see again, and the horses
and cattle standing sober and thinking. Next, the sun come a-blazing
up gay and splendid, and then we began to feel rusty and stretchy, and
first we knowed we was all asleep.



CHAPTER III. TOM EXPLAINS

WE went to sleep about four o'clock, and woke up about eight. The
professor was setting back there at his end, looking glum. He pitched
us some breakfast, but he told us not to come abaft the midship compass.
That was about the middle of the boat. Well, when you are sharp-set,
and you eat and satisfy yourself, everything looks pretty different from
what it done before. It makes a body feel pretty near comfortable, even
when he is up in a balloon with a genius. We got to talking together.

There was one thing that kept bothering me, and by and by I says:

“Tom, didn't we start east?”

“Yes.”

“How fast have we been going?”

“Well, you heard what the professor said when he was raging round.
Sometimes, he said, we was making fifty miles an hour, sometimes ninety,
sometimes a hundred; said that with a gale to help he could make three
hundred any time, and said if he wanted the gale, and wanted it blowing
the right direction, he only had to go up higher or down lower to find
it.”

“Well, then, it's just as I reckoned. The professor lied.”

“Why?”

“Because if we was going so fast we ought to be past Illinois, oughtn't
we?”

“Certainly.”

“Well, we ain't.”

“What's the reason we ain't?”

“I know by the color. We're right over Illinois yet. And you can see for
yourself that Indiana ain't in sight.”

“I wonder what's the matter with you, Huck. You know by the COLOR?”

“Yes, of course I do.”

“What's the color got to do with it?”

“It's got everything to do with it. Illinois is green, Indiana is pink.
You show me any pink down here, if you can. No, sir; it's green.”

“Indiana PINK? Why, what a lie!”

“It ain't no lie; I've seen it on the map, and it's pink.”

You never see a person so aggravated and disgusted. He says:

“Well, if I was such a numbskull as you, Huck Finn, I would jump over.
Seen it on the map! Huck Finn, did you reckon the States was the same
color out-of-doors as they are on the map?”

“Tom Sawyer, what's a map for? Ain't it to learn you facts?”

“Of course.”

“Well, then, how's it going to do that if it tells lies? That's what I
want to know.”

“Shucks, you muggins! It don't tell lies.”

“It don't, don't it?”

“No, it don't.”

“All right, then; if it don't, there ain't no two States the same color.
You git around THAT if you can, Tom Sawyer.”

He see I had him, and Jim see it too; and I tell you, I felt pretty
good, for Tom Sawyer was always a hard person to git ahead of. Jim
slapped his leg and says:

“I tell YOU! dat's smart, dat's right down smart. Ain't no use, Mars
Tom; he got you DIS time, sho'!” He slapped his leg again, and says, “My
LAN', but it was smart one!”

I never felt so good in my life; and yet I didn't know I was saying
anything much till it was out. I was just mooning along, perfectly
careless, and not expecting anything was going to happen, and never
THINKING of such a thing at all, when, all of a sudden, out it came.
Why, it was just as much a surprise to me as it was to any of them. It
was just the same way it is when a person is munching along on a hunk
of corn-pone, and not thinking about anything, and all of a sudden bites
into a di'mond. Now all that HE knows first off is that it's some kind
of gravel he's bit into; but he don't find out it's a di'mond till
he gits it out and brushes off the sand and crumbs and one thing or
another, and has a look at it, and then he's surprised and glad--yes,
and proud too; though when you come to look the thing straight in the
eye, he ain't entitled to as much credit as he would 'a' been if he'd
been HUNTING di'monds. You can see the difference easy if you think it
over. You see, an accident, that way, ain't fairly as big a thing as
a thing that's done a-purpose. Anybody could find that di'mond in that
corn-pone; but mind you, it's got to be somebody that's got THAT KIND
OF A CORN-PONE. That's where that feller's credit comes in, you see;
and that's where mine comes in. I don't claim no great things--I don't
reckon I could 'a' done it again--but I done it that time; that's all I
claim. And I hadn't no more idea I could do such a thing, and warn't any
more thinking about it or trying to, than you be this minute. Why, I was
just as ca'm, a body couldn't be any ca'mer, and yet, all of a sudden,
out it come. I've often thought of that time, and I can remember just
the way everything looked, same as if it was only last week. I can see
it all: beautiful rolling country with woods and fields and lakes
for hundreds and hundreds of miles all around, and towns and villages
scattered everywheres under us, here and there and yonder; and the
professor mooning over a chart on his little table, and Tom's cap
flopping in the rigging where it was hung up to dry. And one thing in
particular was a bird right alongside, not ten foot off, going our way
and trying to keep up, but losing ground all the time; and a railroad
train doing the same thing down there, sliding among the trees and
farms, and pouring out a long cloud of black smoke and now and then a
little puff of white; and when the white was gone so long you had almost
forgot it, you would hear a little faint toot, and that was the whistle.
And we left the bird and the train both behind, 'WAY behind, and done it
easy, too.

But Tom he was huffy, and said me and Jim was a couple of ignorant
blatherskites, and then he says:

“Suppose there's a brown calf and a big brown dog, and an artist is
making a picture of them. What is the MAIN thing that that artist has
got to do? He has got to paint them so you can tell them apart the
minute you look at them, hain't he? Of course. Well, then, do you want
him to go and paint BOTH of them brown? Certainly you don't. He paints
one of them blue, and then you can't make no mistake. It's just the same
with the maps. That's why they make every State a different color; it
ain't to deceive you, it's to keep you from deceiving yourself.”

But I couldn't see no argument about that, and neither could Jim. Jim
shook his head, and says:

“Why, Mars Tom, if you knowed what chuckle-heads dem painters is, you'd
wait a long time before you'd fetch one er DEM in to back up a fac'.
I's gwine to tell you, den you kin see for you'self. I see one of 'em
a-paintin' away, one day, down in ole Hank Wilson's back lot, en I went
down to see, en he was paintin' dat old brindle cow wid de near horn
gone--you knows de one I means. En I ast him what he's paintin' her for,
en he say when he git her painted, de picture's wuth a hundred dollars.
Mars Tom, he could a got de cow fer fifteen, en I tole him so. Well,
sah, if you'll b'lieve me, he jes' shuck his head, dat painter did, en
went on a-dobbin'. Bless you, Mars Tom, DEY don't know nothin'.”

Tom lost his temper. I notice a person 'most always does that's got laid
out in an argument. He told us to shut up, and maybe we'd feel better.
Then he see a town clock away off down yonder, and he took up the glass
and looked at it, and then looked at his silver turnip, and then at the
clock, and then at the turnip again, and says:

“That's funny! That clock's near about an hour fast.”

So he put up his turnip. Then he see another clock, and took a look, and
it was an hour fast too. That puzzled him.

“That's a mighty curious thing,” he says. “I don't understand it.”

Then he took the glass and hunted up another clock, and sure enough it
was an hour fast too. Then his eyes began to spread and his breath to
come out kinder gaspy like, and he says:

“Ger-reat Scott, it's the LONGITUDE!”

I says, considerably scared:

“Well, what's been and gone and happened now?”

“Why, the thing that's happened is that this old bladder has slid over
Illinois and Indiana and Ohio like nothing, and this is the east end of
Pennsylvania or New York, or somewheres around there.”

“Tom Sawyer, you don't mean it!”

“Yes, I do, and it's dead sure. We've covered about fifteen degrees of
longitude since we left St. Louis yesterday afternoon, and them clocks
are right. We've come close on to eight hundred miles.”

I didn't believe it, but it made the cold streaks trickle down my back
just the same. In my experience I knowed it wouldn't take much short of
two weeks to do it down the Mississippi on a raft. Jim was working his
mind and studying. Pretty soon he says:

“Mars Tom, did you say dem clocks uz right?”

“Yes, they're right.”

“Ain't yo' watch right, too?”

“She's right for St. Louis, but she's an hour wrong for here.”

“Mars Tom, is you tryin' to let on dat de time ain't de SAME
everywheres?”

“No, it ain't the same everywheres, by a long shot.”

Jim looked distressed, and says:

“It grieves me to hear you talk like dat, Mars Tom; I's right down
ashamed to hear you talk like dat, arter de way you's been raised.
Yassir, it'd break yo' Aunt Polly's heart to hear you.”

Tom was astonished. He looked Jim over wondering, and didn't say
nothing, and Jim went on:

“Mars Tom, who put de people out yonder in St. Louis? De Lord done it.
Who put de people here whar we is? De Lord done it. Ain' dey bofe his
children? 'Cose dey is. WELL, den! is he gwine to SCRIMINATE 'twixt
'em?”

“Scriminate! I never heard such ignorance. There ain't no discriminating
about it. When he makes you and some more of his children black, and
makes the rest of us white, what do you call that?”

Jim see the p'int. He was stuck. He couldn't answer. Tom says:

“He does discriminate, you see, when he wants to; but this case HERE
ain't no discrimination of his, it's man's. The Lord made the day,
and he made the night; but he didn't invent the hours, and he didn't
distribute them around. Man did that.”

“Mars Tom, is dat so? Man done it?”

“Certainly.”

“Who tole him he could?”

“Nobody. He never asked.”

Jim studied a minute, and says:

“Well, dat do beat me. I wouldn't 'a' tuck no sich resk. But some people
ain't scared o' nothin'. Dey bangs right ahead; DEY don't care what
happens. So den dey's allays an hour's diff'unce everywhah, Mars Tom?”

“An hour? No! It's four minutes difference for every degree of
longitude, you know. Fifteen of 'em's an hour, thirty of 'em's two
hours, and so on. When it's one clock Tuesday morning in England, it's
eight o'clock the night before in New York.”

Jim moved a little way along the locker, and you could see he was
insulted. He kept shaking his head and muttering, and so I slid along to
him and patted him on the leg, and petted him up, and got him over the
worst of his feelings, and then he says:

“Mars Tom talkin' sich talk as dat! Choosday in one place en Monday in
t'other, bofe in the same day! Huck, dis ain't no place to joke--up here
whah we is. Two days in one day! How you gwine to get two days inter one
day? Can't git two hours inter one hour, kin you? Can't git two niggers
inter one nigger skin, kin you? Can't git two gallons of whisky inter
a one-gallon jug, kin you? No, sir, 'twould strain de jug. Yes, en even
den you couldn't, I don't believe. Why, looky here, Huck, s'posen de
Choosday was New Year's--now den! is you gwine to tell me it's dis year
in one place en las' year in t'other, bofe in de identical same minute?
It's de beatenest rubbage! I can't stan' it--I can't stan' to hear tell
'bout it.” Then he begun to shiver and turn gray, and Tom says:

“NOW what's the matter? What's the trouble?”

Jim could hardly speak, but he says:

“Mars Tom, you ain't jokin', en it's SO?”

“No, I'm not, and it is so.”

Jim shivered again, and says:

“Den dat Monday could be de las' day, en dey wouldn't be no las' day
in England, en de dead wouldn't be called. We mustn't go over dah, Mars
Tom. Please git him to turn back; I wants to be whah--”

All of a sudden we see something, and all jumped up, and forgot
everything and begun to gaze. Tom says:

“Ain't that the--” He catched his breath, then says: “It IS, sure as you
live! It's the ocean!”

That made me and Jim catch our breath, too. Then we all stood petrified
but happy, for none of us had ever seen an ocean, or ever expected to.
Tom kept muttering:

“Atlantic Ocean--Atlantic. Land, don't it sound great! And that's
IT--and WE are looking at it--we! Why, it's just too splendid to
believe!”

Then we see a big bank of black smoke; and when we got nearer, it was
a city--and a monster she was, too, with a thick fringe of ships around
one edge; and we wondered if it was New York, and begun to jaw and
dispute about it, and, first we knowed, it slid from under us and went
flying behind, and here we was, out over the very ocean itself, and
going like a cyclone. Then we woke up, I tell you!

We made a break aft and raised a wail, and begun to beg the professor
to turn back and land us, but he jerked out his pistol and motioned us
back, and we went, but nobody will ever know how bad we felt.

The land was gone, all but a little streak, like a snake, away off
on the edge of the water, and down under us was just ocean, ocean,
ocean--millions of miles of it, heaving and pitching and squirming, and
white sprays blowing from the wave-tops, and only a few ships in sight,
wallowing around and laying over, first on one side and then on t'other,
and sticking their bows under and then their sterns; and before long
there warn't no ships at all, and we had the sky and the whole ocean all
to ourselves, and the roomiest place I ever see and the lonesomest.



CHAPTER IV. STORM

AND it got lonesomer and lonesomer. There was the big sky up there,
empty and awful deep; and the ocean down there without a thing on it but
just the waves. All around us was a ring, where the sky and the water
come together; yes, a monstrous big ring it was, and we right in the
dead center of it--plumb in the center. We was racing along like a
prairie fire, but it never made any difference, we couldn't seem to git
past that center no way. I couldn't see that we ever gained an inch
on that ring. It made a body feel creepy, it was so curious and
unaccountable.

Well, everything was so awful still that we got to talking in a very
low voice, and kept on getting creepier and lonesomer and less and less
talky, till at last the talk ran dry altogether, and we just set there
and “thunk,” as Jim calls it, and never said a word the longest time.

The professor never stirred till the sun was overhead, then he stood up
and put a kind of triangle to his eye, and Tom said it was a sextant
and he was taking the sun to see whereabouts the balloon was. Then he
ciphered a little and looked in a book, and then he begun to carry on
again. He said lots of wild things, and, among others, he said he would
keep up this hundred-mile gait till the middle of to-morrow afternoon,
and then he'd land in London.

We said we would be humbly thankful.

He was turning away, but he whirled around when we said that, and
give us a long look of his blackest kind--one of the maliciousest and
suspiciousest looks I ever see. Then he says:

“You want to leave me. Don't try to deny it.”

We didn't know what to say, so we held in and didn't say nothing at all.

He went aft and set down, but he couldn't seem to git that thing out of
his mind. Every now and then he would rip out something about it, and
try to make us answer him, but we dasn't.

It got lonesomer and lonesomer right along, and it did seem to me I
couldn't stand it. It was still worse when night begun to come on. By
and by Tom pinched me and whispers:

“Look!”

I took a glance aft, and see the professor taking a whet out of a
bottle. I didn't like the looks of that. By and by he took another
drink, and pretty soon he begun to sing. It was dark now, and getting
black and stormy. He went on singing, wilder and wilder, and the thunder
begun to mutter, and the wind to wheeze and moan among the ropes, and
altogether it was awful. It got so black we couldn't see him any more,
and wished we couldn't hear him, but we could. Then he got still; but
he warn't still ten minutes till we got suspicious, and wished he would
start up his noise again, so we could tell where he was. By and by
there was a flash of lightning, and we see him start to get up, but he
staggered and fell down. We heard him scream out in the dark:

“They don't want to go to England. All right, I'll change the course.
They want to leave me. I know they do. Well, they shall--and NOW!”

I 'most died when he said that. Then he was still again--still so long I
couldn't bear it, and it did seem to me the lightning wouldn't EVER come
again. But at last there was a blessed flash, and there he was, on his
hands and knees crawling, and not four feet from us. My, but his eyes
was terrible! He made a lunge for Tom, and says, “Overboard YOU go!” but
it was already pitch-dark again, and I couldn't see whether he got him
or not, and Tom didn't make a sound.

There was another long, horrible wait; then there was a flash, and I
see Tom's head sink down outside the boat and disappear. He was on the
rope-ladder that dangled down in the air from the gunnel. The professor
let off a shout and jumped for him, and straight off it was pitch-dark
again, and Jim groaned out, “Po' Mars Tom, he's a goner!” and made a
jump for the professor, but the professor warn't there.

Then we heard a couple of terrible screams, and then another not so
loud, and then another that was 'way below, and you could only JUST hear
it; and I heard Jim say, “Po' Mars Tom!”

Then it was awful still, and I reckon a person could 'a' counted four
thousand before the next flash come. When it come I see Jim on his
knees, with his arms on the locker and his face buried in them, and he
was crying. Before I could look over the edge it was all dark again, and
I was glad, because I didn't want to see. But when the next flash come,
I was watching, and down there I see somebody a-swinging in the wind on
the ladder, and it was Tom!

“Come up!” I shouts; “come up, Tom!”

His voice was so weak, and the wind roared so, I couldn't make out what
he said, but I thought he asked was the professor up there. I shouts:

“No, he's down in the ocean! Come up! Can we help you?”

Of course, all this in the dark.

“Huck, who is you hollerin' at?”

“I'm hollerin' at Tom.”

“Oh, Huck, how kin you act so, when you know po' Mars Tom--” Then he let
off an awful scream, and flung his head and his arms back and let off
another one, because there was a white glare just then, and he had
raised up his face just in time to see Tom's, as white as snow, rise
above the gunnel and look him right in the eye. He thought it was Tom's
ghost, you see.

Tom clumb aboard, and when Jim found it WAS him, and not his ghost, he
hugged him, and called him all sorts of loving names, and carried on
like he was gone crazy, he was so glad. Says I:

“What did you wait for, Tom? Why didn't you come up at first?”

“I dasn't, Huck. I knowed somebody plunged down past me, but I didn't
know who it was in the dark. It could 'a' been you, it could 'a' been
Jim.”

That was the way with Tom Sawyer--always sound. He warn't coming up till
he knowed where the professor was.

The storm let go about this time with all its might; and it was dreadful
the way the thunder boomed and tore, and the lightning glared out, and
the wind sung and screamed in the rigging, and the rain come down. One
second you couldn't see your hand before you, and the next you could
count the threads in your coat-sleeve, and see a whole wide desert of
waves pitching and tossing through a kind of veil of rain. A storm like
that is the loveliest thing there is, but it ain't at its best when you
are up in the sky and lost, and it's wet and lonesome, and there's just
been a death in the family.

We set there huddled up in the bow, and talked low about the poor
professor; and everybody was sorry for him, and sorry the world had
made fun of him and treated him so harsh, when he was doing the best he
could, and hadn't a friend nor nobody to encourage him and keep him from
brooding his mind away and going deranged. There was plenty of clothes
and blankets and everything at the other end, but we thought we'd ruther
take the rain than go meddling back there.



CHAPTER V. LAND

WE tried to make some plans, but we couldn't come to no agreement. Me
and Jim was for turning around and going back home, but Tom allowed that
by the time daylight come, so we could see our way, we would be so far
toward England that we might as well go there, and come back in a ship,
and have the glory of saying we done it.

About midnight the storm quit and the moon come out and lit up the
ocean, and we begun to feel comfortable and drowsy; so we stretched out
on the lockers and went to sleep, and never woke up again till sun-up.
The sea was sparkling like di'monds, and it was nice weather, and pretty
soon our things was all dry again.

We went aft to find some breakfast, and the first thing we noticed was
that there was a dim light burning in a compass back there under a hood.
Then Tom was disturbed. He says:

“You know what that means, easy enough. It means that somebody has got
to stay on watch and steer this thing the same as he would a ship, or
she'll wander around and go wherever the wind wants her to.”

“Well,” I says, “what's she been doing since--er--since we had the
accident?”

“Wandering,” he says, kinder troubled--“wandering, without any doubt.
She's in a wind now that's blowing her south of east. We don't know how
long that's been going on, either.”

So then he p'inted her east, and said he would hold her there till we
rousted out the breakfast. The professor had laid in everything a body
could want; he couldn't 'a' been better fixed. There wasn't no milk for
the coffee, but there was water, and everything else you could want,
and a charcoal stove and the fixings for it, and pipes and cigars and
matches; and wine and liquor, which warn't in our line; and books, and
maps, and charts, and an accordion; and furs, and blankets, and no end
of rubbish, like brass beads and brass jewelry, which Tom said was
a sure sign that he had an idea of visiting among savages. There was
money, too. Yes, the professor was well enough fixed.

After breakfast Tom learned me and Jim how to steer, and divided us all
up into four-hour watches, turn and turn about; and when his watch was
out I took his place, and he got out the professor's papers and pens and
wrote a letter home to his aunt Polly, telling her everything that had
happened to us, and dated it “IN THE WELKIN, APPROACHING ENGLAND,” and
folded it together and stuck it fast with a red wafer, and directed it,
and wrote above the direction, in big writing, “FROM TOM SAWYER, THE
ERRONORT,” and said it would stump old Nat Parsons, the postmaster, when
it come along in the mail. I says:

“Tom Sawyer, this ain't no welkin, it's a balloon.”

“Well, now, who SAID it was a welkin, smarty?”

“You've wrote it on the letter, anyway.”

“What of it? That don't mean that the balloon's the welkin.”

“Oh, I thought it did. Well, then, what is a welkin?”

I see in a minute he was stuck. He raked and scraped around in his mind,
but he couldn't find nothing, so he had to say:

“I don't know, and nobody don't know. It's just a word, and it's a
mighty good word, too. There ain't many that lays over it. I don't
believe there's ANY that does.”

“Shucks!” I says. “But what does it MEAN?--that's the p'int.”

“I don't know what it means, I tell you. It's a word that people uses
for--for--well, it's ornamental. They don't put ruffles on a shirt to
keep a person warm, do they?”

“Course they don't.”

“But they put them ON, don't they?”

“Yes.”

“All right, then; that letter I wrote is a shirt, and the welkin's the
ruffle on it.”

I judged that that would gravel Jim, and it did.

“Now, Mars Tom, it ain't no use to talk like dat; en, moreover, it's
sinful. You knows a letter ain't no shirt, en dey ain't no ruffles on
it, nuther. Dey ain't no place to put 'em on; you can't put em on, and
dey wouldn't stay ef you did.”

“Oh DO shut up, and wait till something's started that you know
something about.”

“Why, Mars Tom, sholy you can't mean to say I don't know about shirts,
when, goodness knows, I's toted home de washin' ever sence--”

“I tell you, this hasn't got anything to do with shirts. I only--”

“Why, Mars Tom, you said yo'self dat a letter--”

“Do you want to drive me crazy? Keep still. I only used it as a
metaphor.”

That word kinder bricked us up for a minute. Then Jim says--rather
timid, because he see Tom was getting pretty tetchy:

“Mars Tom, what is a metaphor?”

“A metaphor's a--well, it's a--a--a metaphor's an illustration.” He see
THAT didn't git home, so he tried again. “When I say birds of a feather
flocks together, it's a metaphorical way of saying--”

“But dey DON'T, Mars Tom. No, sir, 'deed dey don't. Dey ain't no
feathers dat's more alike den a bluebird en a jaybird, but ef you waits
till you catches dem birds together, you'll--”

“Oh, give us a rest! You can't get the simplest little thing through
your thick skull. Now don't bother me any more.”

Jim was satisfied to stop. He was dreadful pleased with himself for
catching Tom out. The minute Tom begun to talk about birds I judged he
was a goner, because Jim knowed more about birds than both of us put
together. You see, he had killed hundreds and hundreds of them, and
that's the way to find out about birds. That's the way people does that
writes books about birds, and loves them so that they'll go hungry and
tired and take any amount of trouble to find a new bird and kill it.
Their name is ornithologers, and I could have been an ornithologer
myself, because I always loved birds and creatures; and I started out to
learn how to be one, and I see a bird setting on a limb of a high tree,
singing with its head tilted back and its mouth open, and before I
thought I fired, and his song stopped and he fell straight down from the
limb, all limp like a rag, and I run and picked him up and he was dead,
and his body was warm in my hand, and his head rolled about this way and
that, like his neck was broke, and there was a little white skin over
his eyes, and one little drop of blood on the side of his head; and,
laws! I couldn't see nothing more for the tears; and I hain't never
murdered no creature since that warn't doing me no harm, and I ain't
going to.

But I was aggravated about that welkin. I wanted to know. I got the
subject up again, and then Tom explained, the best he could. He said
when a person made a big speech the newspapers said the shouts of the
people made the welkin ring. He said they always said that, but none of
them ever told what it was, so he allowed it just meant outdoors and up
high. Well, that seemed sensible enough, so I was satisfied, and said
so. That pleased Tom and put him in a good humor again, and he says:

“Well, it's all right, then; and we'll let bygones be bygones. I don't
know for certain what a welkin is, but when we land in London we'll make
it ring, anyway, and don't you forget it.”

He said an erronort was a person who sailed around in balloons; and said
it was a mighty sight finer to be Tom Sawyer the Erronort than to be Tom
Sawyer the Traveler, and we would be heard of all round the world, if
we pulled through all right, and so he wouldn't give shucks to be a
traveler now.

Toward the middle of the afternoon we got everything ready to land,
and we felt pretty good, too, and proud; and we kept watching with the
glasses, like Columbus discovering America. But we couldn't see nothing
but ocean. The afternoon wasted out and the sun shut down, and still
there warn't no land anywheres. We wondered what was the matter, but
reckoned it would come out all right, so we went on steering east, but
went up on a higher level so we wouldn't hit any steeples or mountains
in the dark.

It was my watch till midnight, and then it was Jim's; but Tom stayed up,
because he said ship captains done that when they was making the land,
and didn't stand no regular watch.

Well, when daylight come, Jim give a shout, and we jumped up and looked
over, and there was the land sure enough--land all around, as far as you
could see, and perfectly level and yaller. We didn't know how long we'd
been over it. There warn't no trees, nor hills, nor rocks, nor towns,
and Tom and Jim had took it for the sea. They took it for the sea in a
dead ca'm; but we was so high up, anyway, that if it had been the sea
and rough, it would 'a' looked smooth, all the same, in the night, that
way.

We was all in a powerful excitement now, and grabbed the glasses and
hunted everywheres for London, but couldn't find hair nor hide of it,
nor any other settlement--nor any sign of a lake or a river, either.
Tom was clean beat. He said it warn't his notion of England; he thought
England looked like America, and always had that idea. So he said we
better have breakfast, and then drop down and inquire the quickest way
to London. We cut the breakfast pretty short, we was so impatient. As
we slanted along down, the weather began to moderate, and pretty soon we
shed our furs. But it kept ON moderating, and in a precious little while
it was 'most too moderate. We was close down now, and just blistering!

We settled down to within thirty foot of the land--that is, it was land
if sand is land; for this wasn't anything but pure sand. Tom and me
clumb down the ladder and took a run to stretch our legs, and it felt
amazing good--that is, the stretching did, but the sand scorched our
feet like hot embers. Next, we see somebody coming, and started to
meet him; but we heard Jim shout, and looked around and he was fairly
dancing, and making signs, and yelling. We couldn't make out what
he said, but we was scared anyway, and begun to heel it back to the
balloon. When we got close enough, we understood the words, and they
made me sick:

“Run! Run fo' yo' life! Hit's a lion; I kin see him thoo de glass!
Run, boys; do please heel it de bes' you kin. He's bu'sted outen de
menagerie, en dey ain't nobody to stop him!”

It made Tom fly, but it took the stiffening all out of my legs. I could
only just gasp along the way you do in a dream when there's a ghost
gaining on you.

Tom got to the ladder and shinned up it a piece and waited for me; and
as soon as I got a foothold on it he shouted to Jim to soar away. But
Jim had clean lost his head, and said he had forgot how. So Tom shinned
along up and told me to follow; but the lion was arriving, fetching a
most ghastly roar with every lope, and my legs shook so I dasn't try to
take one of them out of the rounds for fear the other one would give way
under me.

But Tom was aboard by this time, and he started the balloon up a little,
and stopped it again as soon as the end of the ladder was ten or twelve
feet above ground. And there was the lion, a-ripping around under me,
and roaring and springing up in the air at the ladder, and only missing
it about a quarter of an inch, it seemed to me. It was delicious to
be out of his reach, perfectly delicious, and made me feel good and
thankful all up one side; but I was hanging there helpless and couldn't
climb, and that made me feel perfectly wretched and miserable all down
the other. It is most seldom that a person feels so mixed like that; and
it is not to be recommended, either.

Tom asked me what he'd better do, but I didn't know. He asked me if I
could hold on whilst he sailed away to a safe place and left the lion
behind. I said I could if he didn't go no higher than he was now; but if
he went higher I would lose my head and fall, sure. So he said, “Take a
good grip,” and he started.

“Don't go so fast,” I shouted. “It makes my head swim.”

He had started like a lightning express. He slowed down, and we glided
over the sand slower, but still in a kind of sickening way; for it IS
uncomfortable to see things sliding and gliding under you like that, and
not a sound.

But pretty soon there was plenty of sound, for the lion was catching
up. His noise fetched others. You could see them coming on the lope from
every direction, and pretty soon there was a couple of dozen of them
under me, jumping up at the ladder and snarling and snapping at each
other; and so we went skimming along over the sand, and these fellers
doing what they could to help us to not forgit the occasion; and then
some other beasts come, without an invite, and they started a regular
riot down there.

We see this plan was a mistake. We couldn't ever git away from them
at this gait, and I couldn't hold on forever. So Tom took a think,
and struck another idea. That was, to kill a lion with the pepper-box
revolver, and then sail away while the others stopped to fight over
the carcass. So he stopped the balloon still, and done it, and then we
sailed off while the fuss was going on, and come down a quarter of a
mile off, and they helped me aboard; but by the time we was out of reach
again, that gang was on hand once more. And when they see we was really
gone and they couldn't get us, they sat down on their hams and looked up
at us so kind of disappointed that it was as much as a person could do
not to see THEIR side of the matter.



CHAPTER VI. IT'S A CARAVAN

I WAS so weak that the only thing I wanted was a chance to lay down, so
I made straight for my locker-bunk, and stretched myself out there. But
a body couldn't get back his strength in no such oven as that, so Tom
give the command to soar, and Jim started her aloft.

We had to go up a mile before we struck comfortable weather where it was
breezy and pleasant and just right, and pretty soon I was all straight
again. Tom had been setting quiet and thinking; but now he jumps up and
says:

“I bet you a thousand to one I know where we are. We're in the Great
Sahara, as sure as guns!”

He was so excited he couldn't hold still; but I wasn't. I says:

“Well, then, where's the Great Sahara? In England or in Scotland?”

“'Tain't in either; it's in Africa.”

Jim's eyes bugged out, and he begun to stare down with no end of
interest, because that was where his originals come from; but I didn't
more than half believe it. I couldn't, you know; it seemed too awful far
away for us to have traveled.

But Tom was full of his discovery, as he called it, and said the lions
and the sand meant the Great Desert, sure. He said he could 'a' found
out, before we sighted land, that we was crowding the land somewheres,
if he had thought of one thing; and when we asked him what, he said:

“These clocks. They're chronometers. You always read about them in sea
voyages. One of them is keeping Grinnage time, and the other is keeping
St. Louis time, like my watch. When we left St. Louis it was four in the
afternoon by my watch and this clock, and it was ten at night by this
Grinnage clock. Well, at this time of the year the sun sets at about
seven o'clock. Now I noticed the time yesterday evening when the sun
went down, and it was half-past five o'clock by the Grinnage clock, and
half past 11 A.M. by my watch and the other clock. You see, the sun rose
and set by my watch in St. Louis, and the Grinnage clock was six hours
fast; but we've come so far east that it comes within less than half an
hour of setting by the Grinnage clock now, and I'm away out--more than
four hours and a half out. You see, that meant that we was closing up
on the longitude of Ireland, and would strike it before long if we
was p'inted right--which we wasn't. No, sir, we've been
a-wandering--wandering 'way down south of east, and it's my opinion
we are in Africa. Look at this map. You see how the shoulder of Africa
sticks out to the west. Think how fast we've traveled; if we had gone
straight east we would be long past England by this time. You watch for
noon, all of you, and we'll stand up, and when we can't cast a shadow
we'll find that this Grinnage clock is coming mighty close to marking
twelve. Yes, sir, I think we're in Africa; and it's just bully.”

Jim was gazing down with the glass. He shook his head and says:

“Mars Tom, I reckon dey's a mistake som'er's, hain't seen no niggers
yit.”

“That's nothing; they don't live in the desert. What is that, 'way off
yonder? Gimme a glass.”

He took a long look, and said it was like a black string stretched
across the sand, but he couldn't guess what it was.

“Well,” I says, “I reckon maybe you've got a chance now to find out
whereabouts this balloon is, because as like as not that is one of these
lines here, that's on the map, that you call meridians of longitude, and
we can drop down and look at its number, and--”

“Oh, shucks, Huck Finn, I never see such a lunkhead as you. Did you
s'pose there's meridians of longitude on the EARTH?”

“Tom Sawyer, they're set down on the map, and you know it perfectly
well, and here they are, and you can see for yourself.”

“Of course they're on the map, but that's nothing; there ain't any on
the GROUND.”

“Tom, do you know that to be so?”

“Certainly I do.”

“Well, then, that map's a liar again. I never see such a liar as that
map.”

He fired up at that, and I was ready for him, and Jim was warming his
opinion, too, and next minute we'd 'a' broke loose on another argument,
if Tom hadn't dropped the glass and begun to clap his hands like a
maniac and sing out:

“Camels!--Camels!”

So I grabbed a glass and Jim, too, and took a look, but I was
disappointed, and says:

“Camels your granny; they're spiders.”

“Spiders in a desert, you shad? Spiders walking in a procession? You
don't ever reflect, Huck Finn, and I reckon you really haven't got
anything to reflect WITH. Don't you know we're as much as a mile up in
the air, and that that string of crawlers is two or three miles away?
Spiders, good land! Spiders as big as a cow? Perhaps you'd like to go
down and milk one of 'em. But they're camels, just the same. It's a
caravan, that's what it is, and it's a mile long.”

“Well, then, let's go down and look at it. I don't believe in it, and
ain't going to till I see it and know it.”

“All right,” he says, and give the command:

“Lower away.”

As we come slanting down into the hot weather, we could see that it was
camels, sure enough, plodding along, an everlasting string of them, with
bales strapped to them, and several hundred men in long white robes,
and a thing like a shawl bound over their heads and hanging down with
tassels and fringes; and some of the men had long guns and some hadn't,
and some was riding and some was walking. And the weather--well, it was
just roasting. And how slow they did creep along! We swooped down now,
all of a sudden, and stopped about a hundred yards over their heads.

The men all set up a yell, and some of them fell flat on their stomachs,
some begun to fire their guns at us, and the rest broke and scampered
every which way, and so did the camels.

We see that we was making trouble, so we went up again about a mile, to
the cool weather, and watched them from there. It took them an hour to
get together and form the procession again; then they started along, but
we could see by the glasses that they wasn't paying much attention to
anything but us. We poked along, looking down at them with the glasses,
and by and by we see a big sand mound, and something like people the
other side of it, and there was something like a man laying on top of
the mound that raised his head up every now and then, and seemed to be
watching the caravan or us, we didn't know which. As the caravan got
nearer, he sneaked down on the other side and rushed to the other men
and horses--for that is what they was--and we see them mount in a hurry;
and next, here they come, like a house afire, some with lances and some
with long guns, and all of them yelling the best they could.

They come a-tearing down on to the caravan, and the next minute both
sides crashed together and was all mixed up, and there was such another
popping of guns as you never heard, and the air got so full of smoke you
could only catch glimpses of them struggling together. There must 'a'
been six hundred men in that battle, and it was terrible to see. Then
they broke up into gangs and groups, fighting tooth and nail, and
scurrying and scampering around, and laying into each other like
everything; and whenever the smoke cleared a little you could see dead
and wounded people and camels scattered far and wide and all about, and
camels racing off in every direction.

At last the robbers see they couldn't win, so their chief sounded a
signal, and all that was left of them broke away and went scampering
across the plain. The last man to go snatched up a child and carried it
off in front of him on his horse, and a woman run screaming and begging
after him, and followed him away off across the plain till she was
separated a long ways from her people; but it warn't no use, and she had
to give it up, and we see her sink down on the sand and cover her face
with her hands. Then Tom took the hellum, and started for that yahoo,
and we come a-whizzing down and made a swoop, and knocked him out of
the saddle, child and all; and he was jarred considerable, but the child
wasn't hurt, but laid there working its hands and legs in the air like
a tumble-bug that's on its back and can't turn over. The man went
staggering off to overtake his horse, and didn't know what had hit him,
for we was three or four hundred yards up in the air by this time.

We judged the woman would go and get the child now; but she didn't. We
could see her, through the glass, still setting there, with her head
bowed down on her knees; so of course she hadn't seen the performance,
and thought her child was clean gone with the man. She was nearly a half
a mile from her people, so we thought we might go down to the child,
which was about a quarter of a mile beyond her, and snake it to her
before the caravan people could git to us to do us any harm; and
besides, we reckoned they had enough business on their hands for one
while, anyway, with the wounded. We thought we'd chance it, and we did.
We swooped down and stopped, and Jim shinned down the ladder and fetched
up the kid, which was a nice fat little thing, and in a noble good
humor, too, considering it was just out of a battle and been tumbled off
of a horse; and then we started for the mother, and stopped back of her
and tolerable near by, and Jim slipped down and crept up easy, and when
he was close back of her the child goo-goo'd, the way a child does, and
she heard it, and whirled and fetched a shriek of joy, and made a jump
for the kid and snatched it and hugged it, and dropped it and hugged
Jim, and then snatched off a gold chain and hung it around Jim's neck,
and hugged him again, and jerked up the child again, a-sobbing and
glorifying all the time; and Jim he shoved for the ladder and up it, and
in a minute we was back up in the sky and the woman was staring up, with
the back of her head between her shoulders and the child with its arms
locked around her neck. And there she stood, as long as we was in sight
a-sailing away in the sky.



CHAPTER VII. TOM RESPECTS THE FLEA

“NOON!” says Tom, and so it was. His shadder was just a blot around
his feet. We looked, and the Grinnage clock was so close to twelve the
difference didn't amount to nothing. So Tom said London was right north
of us or right south of us, one or t'other, and he reckoned by the
weather and the sand and the camels it was north; and a good many miles
north, too; as many as from New York to the city of Mexico, he guessed.

Jim said he reckoned a balloon was a good deal the fastest thing in the
world, unless it might be some kinds of birds--a wild pigeon, maybe, or
a railroad.

But Tom said he had read about railroads in England going nearly a
hundred miles an hour for a little ways, and there never was a bird in
the world that could do that--except one, and that was a flea.

“A flea? Why, Mars Tom, in de fust place he ain't a bird, strickly
speakin'--”

“He ain't a bird, eh? Well, then, what is he?”

“I don't rightly know, Mars Tom, but I speck he's only jist a' animal.
No, I reckon dat won't do, nuther, he ain't big enough for a' animal. He
mus' be a bug. Yassir, dat's what he is, he's a bug.”

“I bet he ain't, but let it go. What's your second place?”

“Well, in de second place, birds is creturs dat goes a long ways, but a
flea don't.”

“He don't, don't he? Come, now, what IS a long distance, if you know?”

“Why, it's miles, and lots of 'em--anybody knows dat.”

“Can't a man walk miles?”

“Yassir, he kin.”

“As many as a railroad?”

“Yassir, if you give him time.”

“Can't a flea?”

“Well--I s'pose so--ef you gives him heaps of time.”

“Now you begin to see, don't you, that DISTANCE ain't the thing to judge
by, at all; it's the time it takes to go the distance IN that COUNTS,
ain't it?”

“Well, hit do look sorter so, but I wouldn't 'a' b'lieved it, Mars Tom.”

“It's a matter of PROPORTION, that's what it is; and when you come to
gauge a thing's speed by its size, where's your bird and your man and
your railroad, alongside of a flea? The fastest man can't run more than
about ten miles in an hour--not much over ten thousand times his own
length. But all the books says any common ordinary third-class flea can
jump a hundred and fifty times his own length; yes, and he can make five
jumps a second too--seven hundred and fifty times his own length, in one
little second--for he don't fool away any time stopping and starting--he
does them both at the same time; you'll see, if you try to put your
finger on him. Now that's a common, ordinary, third-class flea's gait;
but you take an Eyetalian FIRST-class, that's been the pet of the
nobility all his life, and hasn't ever knowed what want or sickness
or exposure was, and he can jump more than three hundred times his own
length, and keep it up all day, five such jumps every second, which
is fifteen hundred times his own length. Well, suppose a man could go
fifteen hundred times his own length in a second--say, a mile and a
half. It's ninety miles a minute; it's considerable more than five
thousand miles an hour. Where's your man NOW?--yes, and your bird,
and your railroad, and your balloon? Laws, they don't amount to shucks
'longside of a flea. A flea is just a comet b'iled down small.”

Jim was a good deal astonished, and so was I. Jim said:

“Is dem figgers jist edjackly true, en no jokin' en no lies, Mars Tom?”

“Yes, they are; they're perfectly true.”

“Well, den, honey, a body's got to respec' a flea. I ain't had no
respec' for um befo', sca'sely, but dey ain't no gittin' roun' it, dey
do deserve it, dat's certain.”

“Well, I bet they do. They've got ever so much more sense, and brains,
and brightness, in proportion to their size, than any other cretur in
the world. A person can learn them 'most anything; and they learn it
quicker than any other cretur, too. They've been learnt to haul little
carriages in harness, and go this way and that way and t'other way
according to their orders; yes, and to march and drill like soldiers,
doing it as exact, according to orders, as soldiers does it. They've
been learnt to do all sorts of hard and troublesome things. S'pose you
could cultivate a flea up to the size of a man, and keep his natural
smartness a-growing and a-growing right along up, bigger and bigger, and
keener and keener, in the same proportion--where'd the human race be, do
you reckon? That flea would be President of the United States, and you
couldn't any more prevent it than you can prevent lightning.”

“My lan', Mars Tom, I never knowed dey was so much TO de beas'. No, sir,
I never had no idea of it, and dat's de fac'.”

“There's more to him, by a long sight, than there is to any other
cretur, man or beast, in proportion to size. He's the interestingest
of them all. People have so much to say about an ant's strength, and an
elephant's, and a locomotive's. Shucks, they don't begin with a flea. He
can lift two or three hundred times his own weight. And none of them can
come anywhere near it. And, moreover, he has got notions of his own,
and is very particular, and you can't fool him; his instinct, or his
judgment, or whatever it is, is perfectly sound and clear, and don't
ever make a mistake. People think all humans are alike to a flea. It
ain't so. There's folks that he won't go near, hungry or not hungry, and
I'm one of them. I've never had one of them on me in my life.”

“Mars Tom!”

“It's so; I ain't joking.”

“Well, sah, I hain't ever heard de likes o' dat befo'.” Jim couldn't
believe it, and I couldn't; so we had to drop down to the sand and git a
supply and see. Tom was right. They went for me and Jim by the thousand,
but not a one of them lit on Tom. There warn't no explaining it, but
there it was and there warn't no getting around it. He said it had
always been just so, and he'd just as soon be where there was a million
of them as not; they'd never touch him nor bother him.

We went up to the cold weather to freeze 'em out, and stayed a little
spell, and then come back to the comfortable weather and went lazying
along twenty or twenty-five miles an hour, the way we'd been doing
for the last few hours. The reason was, that the longer we was in that
solemn, peaceful desert, the more the hurry and fuss got kind of soothed
down in us, and the more happier and contented and satisfied we got to
feeling, and the more we got to liking the desert, and then loving it.
So we had cramped the speed down, as I was saying, and was having a most
noble good lazy time, sometimes watching through the glasses, sometimes
stretched out on the lockers reading, sometimes taking a nap.

It didn't seem like we was the same lot that was in such a state to find
land and git ashore, but it was. But we had got over that--clean over
it. We was used to the balloon now and not afraid any more, and didn't
want to be anywheres else. Why, it seemed just like home; it 'most
seemed as if I had been born and raised in it, and Jim and Tom said the
same. And always I had had hateful people around me, a-nagging at me,
and pestering of me, and scolding, and finding fault, and fussing and
bothering, and sticking to me, and keeping after me, and making me do
this, and making me do that and t'other, and always selecting out
the things I didn't want to do, and then giving me Sam Hill because I
shirked and done something else, and just aggravating the life out of a
body all the time; but up here in the sky it was so still and sunshiny
and lovely, and plenty to eat, and plenty of sleep, and strange things
to see, and no nagging and no pestering, and no good people, and just
holiday all the time. Land, I warn't in no hurry to git out and buck at
civilization again. Now, one of the worst things about civilization is,
that anybody that gits a letter with trouble in it comes and tells you
all about it and makes you feel bad, and the newspapers fetches you the
troubles of everybody all over the world, and keeps you downhearted and
dismal 'most all the time, and it's such a heavy load for a person. I
hate them newspapers; and I hate letters; and if I had my way I wouldn't
allow nobody to load his troubles on to other folks he ain't acquainted
with, on t'other side of the world, that way. Well, up in a balloon
there ain't any of that, and it's the darlingest place there is.

We had supper, and that night was one of the prettiest nights I ever
see. The moon made it just like daylight, only a heap softer; and once
we see a lion standing all alone by himself, just all alone on the
earth, it seemed like, and his shadder laid on the sand by him like a
puddle of ink. That's the kind of moonlight to have.

Mainly we laid on our backs and talked; we didn't want to go to sleep.
Tom said we was right in the midst of the Arabian Nights now. He said
it was right along here that one of the cutest things in that book
happened; so we looked down and watched while he told about it, because
there ain't anything that is so interesting to look at as a place that a
book has talked about. It was a tale about a camel-driver that had lost
his camel, and he come along in the desert and met a man, and says:

“Have you run across a stray camel to-day?”

And the man says:

“Was he blind in his left eye?”

“Yes.”

“Had he lost an upper front tooth?”

“Yes.”

“Was his off hind leg lame?”

“Yes.”

“Was he loaded with millet-seed on one side and honey on the other?”

“Yes, but you needn't go into no more details--that's the one, and I'm
in a hurry. Where did you see him?”

“I hain't seen him at all,” the man says.

“Hain't seen him at all? How can you describe him so close, then?”

“Because when a person knows how to use his eyes, everything has got a
meaning to it; but most people's eyes ain't any good to them. I knowed a
camel had been along, because I seen his track. I knowed he was lame in
his off hind leg because he had favored that foot and trod light on it,
and his track showed it. I knowed he was blind on his left side because
he only nibbled the grass on the right side of the trail. I knowed he
had lost an upper front tooth because where he bit into the sod his
teeth-print showed it. The millet-seed sifted out on one side--the ants
told me that; the honey leaked out on the other--the flies told me that.
I know all about your camel, but I hain't seen him.”

Jim says:

“Go on, Mars Tom, hit's a mighty good tale, and powerful interestin'.”

“That's all,” Tom says.

“ALL?” says Jim, astonished. “What 'come o' de camel?”

“I don't know.”

“Mars Tom, don't de tale say?”

“No.”

Jim puzzled a minute, then he says:

“Well! Ef dat ain't de beatenes' tale ever I struck. Jist gits to de
place whah de intrust is gittin' red-hot, en down she breaks. Why, Mars
Tom, dey ain't no SENSE in a tale dat acts like dat. Hain't you got no
IDEA whether de man got de camel back er not?”

“No, I haven't.”

I see myself there warn't no sense in the tale, to chop square off that
way before it come to anything, but I warn't going to say so, because I
could see Tom was souring up pretty fast over the way it flatted out
and the way Jim had popped on to the weak place in it, and I don't think
it's fair for everybody to pile on to a feller when he's down. But Tom
he whirls on me and says:

“What do YOU think of the tale?”

Of course, then, I had to come out and make a clean breast and say it
did seem to me, too, same as it did to Jim, that as long as the tale
stopped square in the middle and never got to no place, it really warn't
worth the trouble of telling.

Tom's chin dropped on his breast, and 'stead of being mad, as I reckoned
he'd be, to hear me scoff at his tale that way, he seemed to be only
sad; and he says:

“Some people can see, and some can't--just as that man said. Let alone
a camel, if a cyclone had gone by, YOU duffers wouldn't 'a' noticed the
track.”

I don't know what he meant by that, and he didn't say; it was just one
of his irrulevances, I reckon--he was full of them, sometimes, when he
was in a close place and couldn't see no other way out--but I didn't
mind. We'd spotted the soft place in that tale sharp enough, he couldn't
git away from that little fact. It graveled him like the nation, too, I
reckon, much as he tried not to let on.



CHAPTER VIII. THE DISAPPEARING LAKE

WE had an early breakfast in the morning, and set looking down on the
desert, and the weather was ever so bammy and lovely, although we warn't
high up. You have to come down lower and lower after sundown in the
desert, because it cools off so fast; and so, by the time it is getting
toward dawn, you are skimming along only a little ways above the sand.

We was watching the shadder of the balloon slide along the ground,
and now and then gazing off across the desert to see if anything was
stirring, and then down on the shadder again, when all of a sudden
almost right under us we see a lot of men and camels laying scattered
about, perfectly quiet, like they was asleep.

We shut off the power, and backed up and stood over them, and then we
see that they was all dead. It give us the cold shivers. And it made us
hush down, too, and talk low, like people at a funeral. We dropped down
slow and stopped, and me and Tom clumb down and went among them. There
was men, and women, and children. They was dried by the sun and dark and
shriveled and leathery, like the pictures of mummies you see in books.
And yet they looked just as human, you wouldn't 'a' believed it; just
like they was asleep.

Some of the people and animals was partly covered with sand, but most of
them not, for the sand was thin there, and the bed was gravel and hard.
Most of the clothes had rotted away; and when you took hold of a rag,
it tore with a touch, like spiderweb. Tom reckoned they had been laying
there for years.

Some of the men had rusty guns by them, some had swords on and had shawl
belts with long, silver-mounted pistols stuck in them. All the camels
had their loads on yet, but the packs had busted or rotted and spilt the
freight out on the ground. We didn't reckon the swords was any good to
the dead people any more, so we took one apiece, and some pistols. We
took a small box, too, because it was so handsome and inlaid so fine;
and then we wanted to bury the people; but there warn't no way to do
it that we could think of, and nothing to do it with but sand, and that
would blow away again, of course.

Then we mounted high and sailed away, and pretty soon that black spot
on the sand was out of sight, and we wouldn't ever see them poor people
again in this world. We wondered, and reasoned, and tried to guess how
they come to be there, and how it all happened to them, but we couldn't
make it out. First we thought maybe they got lost, and wandered around
and about till their food and water give out and they starved to death;
but Tom said no wild animals nor vultures hadn't meddled with them,
and so that guess wouldn't do. So at last we give it up, and judged we
wouldn't think about it no more, because it made us low-spirited.

Then we opened the box, and it had gems and jewels in it, quite a pile,
and some little veils of the kind the dead women had on, with fringes
made out of curious gold money that we warn't acquainted with. We
wondered if we better go and try to find them again and give it back;
but Tom thought it over and said no, it was a country that was full of
robbers, and they would come and steal it; and then the sin would be on
us for putting the temptation in their way. So we went on; but I wished
we had took all they had, so there wouldn't 'a' been no temptation at
all left.

We had had two hours of that blazing weather down there, and was
dreadful thirsty when we got aboard again. We went straight for the
water, but it was spoiled and bitter, besides being pretty near hot
enough to scald your mouth. We couldn't drink it. It was Mississippi
river water, the best in the world, and we stirred up the mud in it
to see if that would help, but no, the mud wasn't any better than the
water. Well, we hadn't been so very, very thirsty before, while we was
interested in the lost people, but we was now, and as soon as we found
we couldn't have a drink, we was more than thirty-five times as thirsty
as we was a quarter of a minute before. Why, in a little while we wanted
to hold our mouths open and pant like a dog.

Tom said to keep a sharp lookout, all around, everywheres, because we'd
got to find an oasis or there warn't no telling what would happen. So we
done it. We kept the glasses gliding around all the time, till our
arms got so tired we couldn't hold them any more. Two hours--three
hours--just gazing and gazing, and nothing but sand, sand, SAND, and you
could see the quivering heat-shimmer playing over it. Dear, dear, a body
don't know what real misery is till he is thirsty all the way through
and is certain he ain't ever going to come to any water any more. At
last I couldn't stand it to look around on them baking plains; I laid
down on the locker, and give it up.

But by and by Tom raised a whoop, and there she was! A lake, wide and
shiny, with pa'm-trees leaning over it asleep, and their shadders in the
water just as soft and delicate as ever you see. I never see anything
look so good. It was a long ways off, but that warn't anything to us; we
just slapped on a hundred-mile gait, and calculated to be there in seven
minutes; but she stayed the same old distance away, all the time; we
couldn't seem to gain on her; yes, sir, just as far, and shiny, and like
a dream; but we couldn't get no nearer; and at last, all of a sudden,
she was gone!

Tom's eyes took a spread, and he says:

“Boys, it was a MYridge!” Said it like he was glad. I didn't see nothing
to be glad about. I says:

“Maybe. I don't care nothing about its name, the thing I want to know
is, what's become of it?”

Jim was trembling all over, and so scared he couldn't speak, but he
wanted to ask that question himself if he could 'a' done it. Tom says:

“What's BECOME of it? Why, you see yourself it's gone.”

“Yes, I know; but where's it gone TO?”

He looked me over and says:

“Well, now, Huck Finn, where WOULD it go to! Don't you know what a
myridge is?”

“No, I don't. What is it?”

“It ain't anything but imagination. There ain't anything TO it.”

It warmed me up a little to hear him talk like that, and I says:

“What's the use you talking that kind of stuff, Tom Sawyer? Didn't I see
the lake?”

“Yes--you think you did.”

“I don't think nothing about it, I DID see it.”

“I tell you you DIDN'T see it either--because it warn't there to see.”

It astonished Jim to hear him talk so, and he broke in and says, kind of
pleading and distressed:

“Mars Tom, PLEASE don't say sich things in sich an awful time as dis.
You ain't only reskin' yo' own self, but you's reskin' us--same way like
Anna Nias en Siffra. De lake WUZ dah--I seen it jis' as plain as I sees
you en Huck dis minute.”

I says:

“Why, he seen it himself! He was the very one that seen it first. NOW,
then!”

“Yes, Mars Tom, hit's so--you can't deny it. We all seen it, en dat
PROVE it was dah.”

“Proves it! How does it prove it?”

“Same way it does in de courts en everywheres, Mars Tom. One pusson
might be drunk, or dreamy or suthin', en he could be mistaken; en two
might, maybe; but I tell you, sah, when three sees a thing, drunk er
sober, it's SO. Dey ain't no gittin' aroun' dat, en you knows it, Mars
Tom.”

“I don't know nothing of the kind. There used to be forty thousand
million people that seen the sun move from one side of the sky to the
other every day. Did that prove that the sun DONE it?”

“Course it did. En besides, dey warn't no 'casion to prove it. A body
'at's got any sense ain't gwine to doubt it. Dah she is now--a sailin'
thoo de sky, like she allays done.”

Tom turned on me, then, and says:

“What do YOU say--is the sun standing still?”

“Tom Sawyer, what's the use to ask such a jackass question? Anybody that
ain't blind can see it don't stand still.”

“Well,” he says, “I'm lost in the sky with no company but a passel
of low-down animals that don't know no more than the head boss of a
university did three or four hundred years ago.”

It warn't fair play, and I let him know it. I says:

“Throwin' mud ain't arguin', Tom Sawyer.”

“Oh, my goodness, oh, my goodness gracious, dah's de lake agi'n!” yelled
Jim, just then. “NOW, Mars Tom, what you gwine to say?”

Yes, sir, there was the lake again, away yonder across the desert,
perfectly plain, trees and all, just the same as it was before. I says:

“I reckon you're satisfied now, Tom Sawyer.”

But he says, perfectly ca'm:

“Yes, satisfied there ain't no lake there.”

Jim says:

“DON'T talk so, Mars Tom--it sk'yers me to hear you. It's so hot, en
you's so thirsty, dat you ain't in yo' right mine, Mars Tom. Oh, but
don't she look good! 'clah I doan' know how I's gwine to wait tell we
gits dah, I's SO thirsty.”

“Well, you'll have to wait; and it won't do you no good, either, because
there ain't no lake there, I tell you.”

I says:

“Jim, don't you take your eye off of it, and I won't, either.”

“'Deed I won't; en bless you, honey, I couldn't ef I wanted to.”

We went a-tearing along toward it, piling the miles behind us like
nothing, but never gaining an inch on it--and all of a sudden it was
gone again! Jim staggered, and 'most fell down. When he got his breath
he says, gasping like a fish:

“Mars Tom, hit's a GHOS', dat's what it is, en I hopes to goodness we
ain't gwine to see it no mo'. Dey's BEEN a lake, en suthin's happened,
en de lake's dead, en we's seen its ghos'; we's seen it twiste, en dat's
proof. De desert's ha'nted, it's ha'nted, sho; oh, Mars Tom, le' 's git
outen it; I'd ruther die den have de night ketch us in it ag'in en de
ghos' er dat lake come a-mournin' aroun' us en we asleep en doan' know
de danger we's in.”

“Ghost, you gander! It ain't anything but air and heat and thirstiness
pasted together by a person's imagination. If I--gimme the glass!”

He grabbed it and begun to gaze off to the right.

“It's a flock of birds,” he says. “It's getting toward sundown, and
they're making a bee-line across our track for somewheres. They mean
business--maybe they're going for food or water, or both. Let her go to
starboard!--Port your hellum! Hard down! There--ease up--steady, as you
go.”

We shut down some of the power, so as not to outspeed them, and took out
after them. We went skimming along a quarter of a mile behind them,
and when we had followed them an hour and a half and was getting pretty
discouraged, and was thirsty clean to unendurableness, Tom says:

“Take the glass, one of you, and see what that is, away ahead of the
birds.”

Jim got the first glimpse, and slumped down on the locker sick. He was
most crying, and says:

“She's dah ag'in, Mars Tom, she's dah ag'in, en I knows I's gwine to
die, 'case when a body sees a ghos' de third time, dat's what it means.
I wisht I'd never come in dis balloon, dat I does.”

He wouldn't look no more, and what he said made me afraid, too, because
I knowed it was true, for that has always been the way with ghosts; so
then I wouldn't look any more, either. Both of us begged Tom to turn
off and go some other way, but he wouldn't, and said we was ignorant
superstitious blatherskites. Yes, and he'll git come up with, one of
these days, I says to myself, insulting ghosts that way. They'll stand
it for a while, maybe, but they won't stand it always, for anybody that
knows about ghosts knows how easy they are hurt, and how revengeful they
are.

So we was all quiet and still, Jim and me being scared, and Tom busy. By
and by Tom fetched the balloon to a standstill, and says:

“NOW get up and look, you sapheads.”

We done it, and there was the sure-enough water right under us!--clear,
and blue, and cool, and deep, and wavy with the breeze, the loveliest
sight that ever was. And all about it was grassy banks, and flowers, and
shady groves of big trees, looped together with vines, and all looking
so peaceful and comfortable--enough to make a body cry, it was so
beautiful.

Jim DID cry, and rip and dance and carry on, he was so thankful and out
of his mind for joy. It was my watch, so I had to stay by the works, but
Tom and Jim clumb down and drunk a barrel apiece, and fetched me up a
lot, and I've tasted a many a good thing in my life, but nothing that
ever begun with that water.

Then we went down and had a swim, and then Tom came up and spelled me,
and me and Jim had a swim, and then Jim spelled Tom, and me and Tom had
a foot-race and a boxing-mill, and I don't reckon I ever had such a
good time in my life. It warn't so very hot, because it was close on to
evening, and we hadn't any clothes on, anyway. Clothes is well enough
in school, and in towns, and at balls, too, but there ain't no sense
in them when there ain't no civilization nor other kinds of bothers and
fussiness around.

“Lions a-comin'!--lions! Quick, Mars Tom! Jump for yo' life, Huck!”

Oh, and didn't we! We never stopped for clothes, but waltzed up the
ladder just so. Jim lost his head straight off--he always done it
whenever he got excited and scared; and so now, 'stead of just easing
the ladder up from the ground a little, so the animals couldn't reach
it, he turned on a raft of power, and we went whizzing up and was
dangling in the sky before he got his wits together and seen what a
foolish thing he was doing. Then he stopped her, but he had clean forgot
what to do next; so there we was, so high that the lions looked like
pups, and we was drifting off on the wind.

But Tom he shinned up and went for the works and begun to slant her
down, and back toward the lake, where the animals was gathering like a
camp-meeting, and I judged he had lost HIS head, too; for he knowed I
was too scared to climb, and did he want to dump me among the tigers and
things?

But no, his head was level, he knowed what he was about. He swooped down
to within thirty or forty feet of the lake, and stopped right over the
center, and sung out:

“Leggo, and drop!”

I done it, and shot down, feet first, and seemed to go about a mile
toward the bottom; and when I come up, he says:

“Now lay on your back and float till you're rested and got your pluck
back, then I'll dip the ladder in the water and you can climb aboard.”

I done it. Now that was ever so smart in Tom, because if he had started
off somewheres else to drop down on the sand, the menagerie would 'a'
come along, too, and might 'a' kept us hunting a safe place till I got
tuckered out and fell.

And all this time the lions and tigers was sorting out the clothes, and
trying to divide them up so there would be some for all, but there was a
misunderstanding about it somewheres, on account of some of them trying
to hog more than their share; so there was another insurrection, and you
never see anything like it in the world. There must 'a' been fifty
of them, all mixed up together, snorting and roaring and snapping and
biting and tearing, legs and tails in the air, and you couldn't tell
which was which, and the sand and fur a-flying. And when they got
done, some was dead and some was limping off crippled, and the rest
was setting around on the battlefield, some of them licking their sore
places and the others looking up at us and seemed to be kind of inviting
us to come down and have some fun, but which we didn't want any.

As for the clothes, they warn't any, any more. Every last rag of them
was inside of the animals; and not agreeing with them very well, I don't
reckon, for there was considerable many brass buttons on them, and there
was knives in the pockets, too, and smoking tobacco, and nails and chalk
and marbles and fishhooks and things. But I wasn't caring. All that was
bothering me was, that all we had now was the professor's clothes, a big
enough assortment, but not suitable to go into company with, if we came
across any, because the britches was as long as tunnels, and the coats
and things according. Still, there was everything a tailor needed, and
Jim was a kind of jack legged tailor, and he allowed he could soon trim
a suit or two down for us that would answer.



CHAPTER IX. TOM DISCOURSES ON THE DESERT

STILL, we thought we would drop down there a minute, but on another
errand. Most of the professor's cargo of food was put up in cans, in the
new way that somebody had just invented; the rest was fresh. When you
fetch Missouri beefsteak to the Great Sahara, you want to be particular
and stay up in the coolish weather. So we reckoned we would drop down
into the lion market and see how we could make out there.

We hauled in the ladder and dropped down till we was just above the
reach of the animals, then we let down a rope with a slip-knot in it and
hauled up a dead lion, a small tender one, then yanked up a cub tiger.
We had to keep the congregation off with the revolver, or they would 'a'
took a hand in the proceedings and helped.

We carved off a supply from both, and saved the skins, and hove the rest
overboard. Then we baited some of the professor's hooks with the fresh
meat and went a-fishing. We stood over the lake just a convenient
distance above the water, and catched a lot of the nicest fish you ever
see. It was a most amazing good supper we had; lion steak, tiger steak,
fried fish, and hot corn-pone. I don't want nothing better than that.

We had some fruit to finish off with. We got it out of the top of a
monstrous tall tree. It was a very slim tree that hadn't a branch on
it from the bottom plumb to the top, and there it bursted out like a
feather-duster. It was a pa'm-tree, of course; anybody knows a pa'm-tree
the minute he see it, by the pictures. We went for cocoanuts in this
one, but there warn't none. There was only big loose bunches of things
like oversized grapes, and Tom allowed they was dates, because he said
they answered the description in the Arabian Nights and the other books.
Of course they mightn't be, and they might be poison; so we had to wait
a spell, and watch and see if the birds et them. They done it; so we
done it, too, and they was most amazing good.

By this time monstrous big birds begun to come and settle on the dead
animals. They was plucky creturs; they would tackle one end of a lion
that was being gnawed at the other end by another lion. If the lion
drove the bird away, it didn't do no good; he was back again the minute
the lion was busy.

The big birds come out of every part of the sky--you could make them out
with the glass while they was still so far away you couldn't see them
with your naked eye. Tom said the birds didn't find out the meat was
there by the smell; they had to find it out by seeing it. Oh, but ain't
that an eye for you! Tom said at the distance of five mile a patch of
dead lions couldn't look any bigger than a person's finger-nail, and he
couldn't imagine how the birds could notice such a little thing so far
off.

It was strange and unnatural to see lion eat lion, and we thought maybe
they warn't kin. But Jim said that didn't make no difference. He said a
hog was fond of her own children, and so was a spider, and he reckoned
maybe a lion was pretty near as unprincipled though maybe not quite. He
thought likely a lion wouldn't eat his own father, if he knowed which
was him, but reckoned he would eat his brother-in-law if he was uncommon
hungry, and eat his mother-in-law any time. But RECKONING don't settle
nothing. You can reckon till the cows come home, but that don't fetch
you to no decision. So we give it up and let it drop.

Generly it was very still in the Desert nights, but this time there was
music. A lot of other animals come to dinner; sneaking yelpers that Tom
allowed was jackals, and roached-backed ones that he said was hyenas;
and all the whole biling of them kept up a racket all the time. They
made a picture in the moonlight that was more different than any picture
I ever see. We had a line out and made fast to the top of a tree, and
didn't stand no watch, but all turned in and slept; but I was up two or
three times to look down at the animals and hear the music. It was like
having a front seat at a menagerie for nothing, which I hadn't ever had
before, and so it seemed foolish to sleep and not make the most of it; I
mightn't ever have such a chance again.

We went a-fishing again in the early dawn, and then lazied around all
day in the deep shade on an island, taking turn about to watch and see
that none of the animals come a-snooping around there after erronorts
for dinner. We was going to leave the next day, but couldn't, it was too
lovely.

The day after, when we rose up toward the sky and sailed off eastward,
we looked back and watched that place till it warn't nothing but just
a speck in the Desert, and I tell you it was like saying good-bye to a
friend that you ain't ever going to see any more.

Jim was thinking to himself, and at last he says:

“Mars Tom, we's mos' to de end er de Desert now, I speck.”

“Why?”

“Well, hit stan' to reason we is. You knows how long we's been
a-skimmin' over it. Mus' be mos' out o' san'. Hit's a wonder to me dat
it's hilt out as long as it has.”

“Shucks, there's plenty sand, you needn't worry.”

“Oh, I ain't a-worryin', Mars Tom, only wonderin', dat's all. De Lord's
got plenty san', I ain't doubtin' dat; but nemmine, He ain't gwyne to
WAS'E it jist on dat account; en I allows dat dis Desert's plenty big
enough now, jist de way she is, en you can't spread her out no mo' 'dout
was'in' san'.”

“Oh, go 'long! we ain't much more than fairly STARTED across this Desert
yet. The United States is a pretty big country, ain't it? Ain't it,
Huck?”

“Yes,” I says, “there ain't no bigger one, I don't reckon.”

“Well,” he says, “this Desert is about the shape of the United States,
and if you was to lay it down on top of the United States, it would
cover the land of the free out of sight like a blanket. There'd be
a little corner sticking out, up at Maine and away up northwest, and
Florida sticking out like a turtle's tail, and that's all. We've took
California away from the Mexicans two or three years ago, so that part
of the Pacific coast is ours now, and if you laid the Great Sahara down
with her edge on the Pacific, she would cover the United States and
stick out past New York six hundred miles into the Atlantic ocean.”

I say:

“Good land! have you got the documents for that, Tom Sawyer?”

“Yes, and they're right here, and I've been studying them. You can look
for yourself. From New York to the Pacific is 2,600 miles. From one end
of the Great Desert to the other is 3,200. The United States contains
3,600,000 square miles, the Desert contains 4,162,000. With the Desert's
bulk you could cover up every last inch of the United States, and in
under where the edges projected out, you could tuck England, Scotland,
Ireland, France, Denmark, and all Germany. Yes, sir, you could hide the
home of the brave and all of them countries clean out of sight under the
Great Sahara, and you would still have 2,000 square miles of sand left.”

“Well,” I says, “it clean beats me. Why, Tom, it shows that the Lord
took as much pains makin' this Desert as makin' the United States and
all them other countries.”

Jim says: “Huck, dat don' stan' to reason. I reckon dis Desert wa'n't
made at all. Now you take en look at it like dis--you look at it, and
see ef I's right. What's a desert good for? 'Taint good for nuthin'. Dey
ain't no way to make it pay. Hain't dat so, Huck?”

“Yes, I reckon.”

“Hain't it so, Mars Tom?”

“I guess so. Go on.”

“Ef a thing ain't no good, it's made in vain, ain't it?”

“Yes.”

“NOW, den! Do de Lord make anything in vain? You answer me dat.”

“Well--no, He don't.”

“Den how come He make a desert?”

“Well, go on. How DID He come to make it?”

“Mars Tom, I b'lieve it uz jes like when you's buildin' a house; dey's
allays a lot o' truck en rubbish lef' over. What does you do wid it?
Doan' you take en k'yart it off en dump it into a ole vacant back lot?
'Course. Now, den, it's my opinion hit was jes like dat--dat de Great
Sahara warn't made at all, she jes HAPPEN'.”

I said it was a real good argument, and I believed it was the best
one Jim ever made. Tom he said the same, but said the trouble about
arguments is, they ain't nothing but THEORIES, after all, and theories
don't prove nothing, they only give you a place to rest on, a spell,
when you are tuckered out butting around and around trying to find out
something there ain't no way TO find out. And he says:

“There's another trouble about theories: there's always a hole in them
somewheres, sure, if you look close enough. It's just so with this one
of Jim's. Look what billions and billions of stars there is. How does it
come that there was just exactly enough star-stuff, and none left over?
How does it come there ain't no sand-pile up there?”

But Jim was fixed for him and says:

“What's de Milky Way?--dat's what I want to know. What's de Milky Way?
Answer me dat!”

In my opinion it was just a sockdologer. It's only an opinion, it's
only MY opinion and others may think different; but I said it then and I
stand to it now--it was a sockdologer. And moreover, besides, it landed
Tom Sawyer. He couldn't say a word. He had that stunned look of a person
that's been shot in the back with a kag of nails. All he said was,
as for people like me and Jim, he'd just as soon have intellectual
intercourse with a catfish. But anybody can say that--and I notice they
always do, when somebody has fetched them a lifter. Tom Sawyer was tired
of that end of the subject.

  So we got back to talking about the size of the Desert again, and the
more we compared it with this and that and t'other thing, the more
nobler and bigger and grander it got to look right along. And so,
hunting among the figgers, Tom found, by and by, that it was just the
same size as the Empire of China. Then he showed us the spread the
Empire of China made on the map, and the room she took up in the world.
Well, it was wonderful to think of, and I says:

“Why, I've heard talk about this Desert plenty of times, but I never
knowed before how important she was.”

Then Tom says:

“Important! Sahara important! That's just the way with some people. If a
thing's big, it's important. That's all the sense they've got. All they
can see is SIZE. Why, look at England. It's the most important country
in the world; and yet you could put it in China's vest-pocket; and not
only that, but you'd have the dickens's own time to find it again the
next time you wanted it. And look at Russia. It spreads all around and
everywhere, and yet ain't no more important in this world than Rhode
Island is, and hasn't got half as much in it that's worth saving.”

Away off now we see a little hill, a-standing up just on the edge of
the world. Tom broke off his talk, and reached for a glass very much
excited, and took a look, and says:

“That's it--it's the one I've been looking for, sure. If I'm right, it's
the one the dervish took the man into and showed him all the treasures.”

So we begun to gaze, and he begun to tell about it out of the Arabian
Nights.



CHAPTER X. THE TREASURE-HILL

TOM said it happened like this.

A dervish was stumping it along through the Desert, on foot, one blazing
hot day, and he had come a thousand miles and was pretty poor, and
hungry, and ornery and tired, and along about where we are now he run
across a camel-driver with a hundred camels, and asked him for some
a'ms. But the cameldriver he asked to be excused. The dervish said:

“Don't you own these camels?”

“Yes, they're mine.”

“Are you in debt?”

“Who--me? No.”

“Well, a man that owns a hundred camels and ain't in debt is rich--and
not only rich, but very rich. Ain't it so?”

The camel-driver owned up that it was so. Then the dervish says:

“God has made you rich, and He has made me poor. He has His reasons,
and they are wise, blessed be His name. But He has willed that His rich
shall help His poor, and you have turned away from me, your brother, in
my need, and He will remember this, and you will lose by it.”

That made the camel-driver feel shaky, but all the same he was born
hoggish after money and didn't like to let go a cent; so he begun to
whine and explain, and said times was hard, and although he had took a
full freight down to Balsora and got a fat rate for it, he couldn't git
no return freight, and so he warn't making no great things out of his
trip. So the dervish starts along again, and says:

“All right, if you want to take the risk; but I reckon you've made a
mistake this time, and missed a chance.”

Of course the camel-driver wanted to know what kind of a chance he
had missed, because maybe there was money in it; so he run after the
dervish, and begged him so hard and earnest to take pity on him that at
last the dervish gave in, and says:

“Do you see that hill yonder? Well, in that hill is all the treasures
of the earth, and I was looking around for a man with a particular good
kind heart and a noble, generous disposition, because if I could find
just that man, I've got a kind of a salve I could put on his eyes and he
could see the treasures and get them out.”

So then the camel-driver was in a sweat; and he cried, and begged, and
took on, and went down on his knees, and said he was just that kind of a
man, and said he could fetch a thousand people that would say he wasn't
ever described so exact before.

“Well, then,” says the dervish, “all right. If we load the hundred
camels, can I have half of them?”

The driver was so glad he couldn't hardly hold in, and says:

“Now you're shouting.”

So they shook hands on the bargain, and the dervish got out his box and
rubbed the salve on the driver's right eye, and the hill opened and he
went in, and there, sure enough, was piles and piles of gold and jewels
sparkling like all the stars in heaven had fell down.

So him and the dervish laid into it, and they loaded every camel till
he couldn't carry no more; then they said good-bye, and each of them
started off with his fifty. But pretty soon the camel-driver come
a-running and overtook the dervish and says:

“You ain't in society, you know, and you don't really need all you've
got. Won't you be good, and let me have ten of your camels?”

“Well,” the dervish says, “I don't know but what you say is reasonable
enough.”

So he done it, and they separated and the dervish started off again with
his forty. But pretty soon here comes the camel-driver bawling after him
again, and whines and slobbers around and begs another ten off of him,
saying thirty camel loads of treasures was enough to see a dervish
through, because they live very simple, you know, and don't keep house,
but board around and give their note.

But that warn't the end yet. That ornery hound kept coming and coming
till he had begged back all the camels and had the whole hundred. Then
he was satisfied, and ever so grateful, and said he wouldn't ever forgit
the dervish as long as he lived, and nobody hadn't been so good to him
before, and liberal. So they shook hands good-bye, and separated and
started off again.

But do you know, it warn't ten minutes till the camel-driver was
unsatisfied again--he was the lowdownest reptyle in seven counties--and
he come a-running again. And this time the thing he wanted was to get
the dervish to rub some of the salve on his other eye.

“Why?” said the dervish.

“Oh, you know,” says the driver.

“Know what?”

“Well, you can't fool me,” says the driver. “You're trying to keep back
something from me, you know it mighty well. You know, I reckon, that if
I had the salve on the other eye I could see a lot more things that's
valuable. Come--please put it on.”

The dervish says:

“I wasn't keeping anything back from you. I don't mind telling you what
would happen if I put it on. You'd never see again. You'd be stone-blind
the rest of your days.”

But do you know that beat wouldn't believe him. No, he begged and
begged, and whined and cried, till at last the dervish opened his box
and told him to put it on, if he wanted to. So the man done it, and sure
enough he was as blind as a bat in a minute.

Then the dervish laughed at him and mocked at him and made fun of him;
and says:

“Good-bye--a man that's blind hain't got no use for jewelry.”

And he cleared out with the hundred camels, and left that man to wander
around poor and miserable and friendless the rest of his days in the
Desert.

Jim said he'd bet it was a lesson to him.

“Yes,” Tom says, “and like a considerable many lessons a body gets.
They ain't no account, because the thing don't ever happen the same way
again--and can't. The time Hen Scovil fell down the chimbly and crippled
his back for life, everybody said it would be a lesson to him. What kind
of a lesson? How was he going to use it? He couldn't climb chimblies no
more, and he hadn't no more backs to break.”

“All de same, Mars Tom, dey IS sich a thing as learnin' by expe'ence. De
Good Book say de burnt chile shun de fire.”

“Well, I ain't denying that a thing's a lesson if it's a thing that can
happen twice just the same way. There's lots of such things, and THEY
educate a person, that's what Uncle Abner always said; but there's forty
MILLION lots of the other kind--the kind that don't happen the same way
twice--and they ain't no real use, they ain't no more instructive than
the small-pox. When you've got it, it ain't no good to find out you
ought to been vaccinated, and it ain't no good to git vaccinated
afterward, because the small-pox don't come but once. But, on the other
hand, Uncle Abner said that the person that had took a bull by the tail
once had learnt sixty or seventy times as much as a person that hadn't,
and said a person that started in to carry a cat home by the tail was
gitting knowledge that was always going to be useful to him, and warn't
ever going to grow dim or doubtful. But I can tell you, Jim, Uncle Abner
was down on them people that's all the time trying to dig a lesson out
of everything that happens, no matter whether--”

But Jim was asleep. Tom looked kind of ashamed, because you know a
person always feels bad when he is talking uncommon fine and thinks the
other person is admiring, and that other person goes to sleep that way.
Of course he oughtn't to go to sleep, because it's shabby; but the finer
a person talks the certainer it is to make you sleep, and so when you
come to look at it it ain't nobody's fault in particular; both of them's
to blame.

Jim begun to snore--soft and blubbery at first, then a long rasp, then
a stronger one, then a half a dozen horrible ones like the last water
sucking down the plug-hole of a bath-tub, then the same with more power
to it, and some big coughs and snorts flung in, the way a cow does that
is choking to death; and when the person has got to that point he is at
his level best, and can wake up a man that is in the next block with
a dipperful of loddanum in him, but can't wake himself up although all
that awful noise of his'n ain't but three inches from his own ears. And
that is the curiosest thing in the world, seems to me. But you rake a
match to light the candle, and that little bit of a noise will fetch
him. I wish I knowed what was the reason of that, but there don't seem
to be no way to find out. Now there was Jim alarming the whole Desert,
and yanking the animals out, for miles and miles around, to see what in
the nation was going on up there; there warn't nobody nor nothing that
was as close to the noise as HE was, and yet he was the only cretur that
wasn't disturbed by it. We yelled at him and whooped at him, it never
done no good; but the first time there come a little wee noise that
wasn't of a usual kind it woke him up. No, sir, I've thought it all
over, and so has Tom, and there ain't no way to find out why a snorer
can't hear himself snore.

Jim said he hadn't been asleep; he just shut his eyes so he could listen
better.

Tom said nobody warn't accusing him.

That made him look like he wished he hadn't said anything. And he wanted
to git away from the subject, I reckon, because he begun to abuse the
camel-driver, just the way a person does when he has got catched in
something and wants to take it out of somebody else. He let into the
camel-driver the hardest he knowed how, and I had to agree with him; and
he praised up the dervish the highest he could, and I had to agree with
him there, too. But Tom says:

“I ain't so sure. You call that dervish so dreadful liberal and good
and unselfish, but I don't quite see it. He didn't hunt up another poor
dervish, did he? No, he didn't. If he was so unselfish, why didn't he
go in there himself and take a pocketful of jewels and go along and
be satisfied? No, sir, the person he was hunting for was a man with a
hundred camels. He wanted to get away with all the treasure he could.”

“Why, Mars Tom, he was willin' to divide, fair and square; he only
struck for fifty camels.”

“Because he knowed how he was going to get all of them by and by.”

“Mars Tom, he TOLE de man de truck would make him bline.”

“Yes, because he knowed the man's character. It was just the kind of a
man he was hunting for--a man that never believes in anybody's word or
anybody's honorableness, because he ain't got none of his own. I reckon
there's lots of people like that dervish. They swindle, right and left,
but they always make the other person SEEM to swindle himself. They keep
inside of the letter of the law all the time, and there ain't no way
to git hold of them. THEY don't put the salve on--oh, no, that would
be sin; but they know how to fool YOU into putting it on, then it's you
that blinds yourself. I reckon the dervish and the camel-driver was just
a pair--a fine, smart, brainy rascal, and a dull, coarse, ignorant one,
but both of them rascals, just the same.”

“Mars Tom, does you reckon dey's any o' dat kind o' salve in de worl'
now?”

“Yes, Uncle Abner says there is. He says they've got it in New York, and
they put it on country people's eyes and show them all the railroads in
the world, and they go in and git them, and then when they rub the salve
on the other eye the other man bids them goodbye and goes off with their
railroads. Here's the treasure-hill now. Lower away!”

We landed, but it warn't as interesting as I thought it was going to
be, because we couldn't find the place where they went in to git the
treasure. Still, it was plenty interesting enough, just to see the mere
hill itself where such a wonderful thing happened. Jim said he wou'dn't
'a' missed it for three dollars, and I felt the same way.

And to me and Jim, as wonderful a thing as any was the way Tom could
come into a strange big country like this and go straight and find a
little hump like that and tell it in a minute from a million other humps
that was almost just like it, and nothing to help him but only his own
learning and his own natural smartness. We talked and talked it over
together, but couldn't make out how he done it. He had the best head on
him I ever see; and all he lacked was age, to make a name for himself
equal to Captain Kidd or George Washington. I bet you it would 'a'
crowded either of THEM to find that hill, with all their gifts, but it
warn't nothing to Tom Sawyer; he went across Sahara and put his finger
on it as easy as you could pick a nigger out of a bunch of angels.

We found a pond of salt water close by and scraped up a raft of salt
around the edges, and loaded up the lion's skin and the tiger's so as
they would keep till Jim could tan them.



CHAPTER XI. THE SAND-STORM

WE went a-fooling along for a day or two, and then just as the full moon
was touching the ground on the other side of the desert, we see a string
of little black figgers moving across its big silver face. You could
see them as plain as if they was painted on the moon with ink. It was
another caravan. We cooled down our speed and tagged along after it,
just to have company, though it warn't going our way. It was a rattler,
that caravan, and a most bully sight to look at next morning when the
sun come a-streaming across the desert and flung the long shadders of
the camels on the gold sand like a thousand grand-daddy-long-legses
marching in procession. We never went very near it, because we knowed
better now than to act like that and scare people's camels and break up
their caravans. It was the gayest outfit you ever see, for rich clothes
and nobby style. Some of the chiefs rode on dromedaries, the first we
ever see, and very tall, and they go plunging along like they was on
stilts, and they rock the man that is on them pretty violent and churn
up his dinner considerable, I bet you, but they make noble good time,
and a camel ain't nowheres with them for speed.

The caravan camped, during the middle part of the day, and then started
again about the middle of the afternoon. Before long the sun begun to
look very curious. First it kind of turned to brass, and then to copper,
and after that it begun to look like a blood-red ball, and the air got
hot and close, and pretty soon all the sky in the west darkened up and
looked thick and foggy, but fiery and dreadful--like it looks through
a piece of red glass, you know. We looked down and see a big confusion
going on in the caravan, and a rushing every which way like they was
scared; and then they all flopped down flat in the sand and laid there
perfectly still.

Pretty soon we see something coming that stood up like an amazing wide
wall, and reached from the Desert up into the sky and hid the sun, and
it was coming like the nation, too. Then a little faint breeze struck
us, and then it come harder, and grains of sand begun to sift against
our faces and sting like fire, and Tom sung out:

“It's a sand-storm--turn your backs to it!”

We done it; and in another minute it was blowing a gale, and the sand
beat against us by the shovelful, and the air was so thick with it we
couldn't see a thing. In five minutes the boat was level full, and we
was setting on the lockers buried up to the chin in sand, and only our
heads out and could hardly breathe.

Then the storm thinned, and we see that monstrous wall go a-sailing off
across the desert, awful to look at, I tell you. We dug ourselves out
and looked down, and where the caravan was before there wasn't anything
but just the sand ocean now, and all still and quiet. All them people
and camels was smothered and dead and buried--buried under ten foot of
sand, we reckoned, and Tom allowed it might be years before the wind
uncovered them, and all that time their friends wouldn't ever know what
become of that caravan. Tom said:

“NOW we know what it was that happened to the people we got the swords
and pistols from.”

Yes, sir, that was just it. It was as plain as day now. They got buried
in a sand-storm, and the wild animals couldn't get at them, and the wind
never uncovered them again until they was dried to leather and warn't
fit to eat. It seemed to me we had felt as sorry for them poor people as
a person could for anybody, and as mournful, too, but we was mistaken;
this last caravan's death went harder with us, a good deal harder.
You see, the others was total strangers, and we never got to feeling
acquainted with them at all, except, maybe, a little with the man that
was watching the girl, but it was different with this last caravan. We
was huvvering around them a whole night and 'most a whole day, and had
got to feeling real friendly with them, and acquainted. I have found
out that there ain't no surer way to find out whether you like people or
hate them than to travel with them. Just so with these. We kind of liked
them from the start, and traveling with them put on the finisher. The
longer we traveled with them, and the more we got used to their ways,
the better and better we liked them, and the gladder and gladder we was
that we run across them. We had come to know some of them so well that
we called them by name when we was talking about them, and soon got so
familiar and sociable that we even dropped the Miss and Mister and just
used their plain names without any handle, and it did not seem unpolite,
but just the right thing. Of course, it wasn't their own names, but
names we give them. There was Mr. Elexander Robinson and Miss Adaline
Robinson, and Colonel Jacob McDougal and Miss Harryet McDougal, and
Judge Jeremiah Butler and young Bushrod Butler, and these was big chiefs
mostly that wore splendid great turbans and simmeters, and dressed like
the Grand Mogul, and their families. But as soon as we come to know them
good, and like them very much, it warn't Mister, nor Judge, nor nothing,
any more, but only Elleck, and Addy, and Jake, and Hattie, and Jerry,
and Buck, and so on.

And you know the more you join in with people in their joys and their
sorrows, the more nearer and dearer they come to be to you. Now we
warn't cold and indifferent, the way most travelers is, we was right
down friendly and sociable, and took a chance in everything that was
going, and the caravan could depend on us to be on hand every time, it
didn't make no difference what it was.

When they camped, we camped right over them, ten or twelve hundred feet
up in the air. When they et a meal, we et ourn, and it made it ever
so much home-liker to have their company. When they had a wedding that
night, and Buck and Addy got married, we got ourselves up in the very
starchiest of the professor's duds for the blow-out, and when they
danced we jined in and shook a foot up there.

But it is sorrow and trouble that brings you the nearest, and it was
a funeral that done it with us. It was next morning, just in the still
dawn. We didn't know the diseased, and he warn't in our set, but that
never made no difference; he belonged to the caravan, and that was
enough, and there warn't no more sincerer tears shed over him than the
ones we dripped on him from up there eleven hundred foot on high.

Yes, parting with this caravan was much more bitterer than it was to
part with them others, which was comparative strangers, and been dead so
long, anyway. We had knowed these in their lives, and was fond of them,
too, and now to have death snatch them from right before our faces while
we was looking, and leave us so lonesome and friendless in the middle of
that big desert, it did hurt so, and we wished we mightn't ever make
any more friends on that voyage if we was going to lose them again like
that.

We couldn't keep from talking about them, and they was all the time
coming up in our memory, and looking just the way they looked when we
was all alive and happy together. We could see the line marching, and
the shiny spearheads a-winking in the sun; we could see the dromedaries
lumbering along; we could see the wedding and the funeral; and more
oftener than anything else we could see them praying, because they don't
allow nothing to prevent that; whenever the call come, several times a
day, they would stop right there, and stand up and face to the east, and
lift back their heads, and spread out their arms and begin, and four or
five times they would go down on their knees, and then fall forward and
touch their forehead to the ground.

Well, it warn't good to go on talking about them, lovely as they was
in their life, and dear to us in their life and death both, because
it didn't do no good, and made us too down-hearted. Jim allowed he was
going to live as good a life as he could, so he could see them again
in a better world; and Tom kept still and didn't tell him they was only
Mohammedans; it warn't no use to disappoint him, he was feeling bad
enough just as it was.

When we woke up next morning we was feeling a little cheerfuller, and
had had a most powerful good sleep, because sand is the comfortablest
bed there is, and I don't see why people that can afford it don't have
it more. And it's terrible good ballast, too; I never see the balloon so
steady before.

Tom allowed we had twenty tons of it, and wondered what we better do
with it; it was good sand, and it didn't seem good sense to throw it
away. Jim says:

“Mars Tom, can't we tote it back home en sell it? How long'll it take?”

“Depends on the way we go.”

“Well, sah, she's wuth a quarter of a dollar a load at home, en I reckon
we's got as much as twenty loads, hain't we? How much would dat be?”

“Five dollars.”

“By jings, Mars Tom, le's shove for home right on de spot! Hit's more'n
a dollar en a half apiece, hain't it?”

“Yes.”

“Well, ef dat ain't makin' money de easiest ever I struck! She jes'
rained in--never cos' us a lick o' work. Le's mosey right along, Mars
Tom.”

But Tom was thinking and ciphering away so busy and excited he never
heard him. Pretty soon he says:

“Five dollars--sho! Look here, this sand's worth--worth--why, it's worth
no end of money.”

“How is dat, Mars Tom? Go on, honey, go on!”

“Well, the minute people knows it's genuwyne sand from the genuwyne
Desert of Sahara, they'll just be in a perfect state of mind to git hold
of some of it to keep on the what-not in a vial with a label on it for
a curiosity. All we got to do is to put it up in vials and float around
all over the United States and peddle them out at ten cents apiece.
We've got all of ten thousand dollars' worth of sand in this boat.”

Me and Jim went all to pieces with joy, and begun to shout
whoopjamboreehoo, and Tom says:

“And we can keep on coming back and fetching sand, and coming back and
fetching more sand, and just keep it a-going till we've carted this
whole Desert over there and sold it out; and there ain't ever going to
be any opposition, either, because we'll take out a patent.”

“My goodness,” I says, “we'll be as rich as Creosote, won't we, Tom?”

“Yes--Creesus, you mean. Why, that dervish was hunting in that little
hill for the treasures of the earth, and didn't know he was walking
over the real ones for a thousand miles. He was blinder than he made the
driver.”

“Mars Tom, how much is we gwyne to be worth?”

“Well, I don't know yet. It's got to be ciphered, and it ain't the
easiest job to do, either, because it's over four million square miles
of sand at ten cents a vial.”

Jim was awful excited, but this faded it out considerable, and he shook
his head and says:

“Mars Tom, we can't 'ford all dem vials--a king couldn't. We better not
try to take de whole Desert, Mars Tom, de vials gwyne to bust us, sho'.”

Tom's excitement died out, too, now, and I reckoned it was on account
of the vials, but it wasn't. He set there thinking, and got bluer and
bluer, and at last he says:

“Boys, it won't work; we got to give it up.”

“Why, Tom?”

“On account of the duties.”

I couldn't make nothing out of that, neither could Jim. I says:

“What IS our duty, Tom? Because if we can't git around it, why can't we
just DO it? People often has to.”

But he says:

“Oh, it ain't that kind of duty. The kind I mean is a tax. Whenever you
strike a frontier--that's the border of a country, you know--you find a
custom-house there, and the gov'ment officers comes and rummages among
your things and charges a big tax, which they call a duty because
it's their duty to bust you if they can, and if you don't pay the duty
they'll hog your sand. They call it confiscating, but that don't deceive
nobody, it's just hogging, and that's all it is. Now if we try to carry
this sand home the way we're pointed now, we got to climb fences till we
git tired--just frontier after frontier--Egypt, Arabia, Hindostan, and
so on, and they'll all whack on a duty, and so you see, easy enough, we
CAN'T go THAT road.”

“Why, Tom,” I says, “we can sail right over their old frontiers; how are
THEY going to stop us?”

He looked sorrowful at me, and says, very grave:

“Huck Finn, do you think that would be honest?”

I hate them kind of interruptions. I never said nothing, and he went on:

“Well, we're shut off the other way, too. If we go back the way we've
come, there's the New York custom-house, and that is worse than all of
them others put together, on account of the kind of cargo we've got.”

“Why?”

“Well, they can't raise Sahara sand in America, of course, and when they
can't raise a thing there, the duty is fourteen hundred thousand per
cent. on it if you try to fetch it in from where they do raise it.”

“There ain't no sense in that, Tom Sawyer.”

“Who said there WAS? What do you talk to me like that for, Huck Finn?
You wait till I say a thing's got sense in it before you go to accusing
me of saying it.”

“All right, consider me crying about it, and sorry. Go on.”

Jim says:

“Mars Tom, do dey jam dat duty onto everything we can't raise in
America, en don't make no 'stinction 'twix' anything?”

“Yes, that's what they do.”

“Mars Tom, ain't de blessin' o' de Lord de mos' valuable thing dey is?”

“Yes, it is.”

“Don't de preacher stan' up in de pulpit en call it down on de people?”

“Yes.”

“Whah do it come from?”

“From heaven.”

“Yassir! you's jes' right, 'deed you is, honey--it come from heaven, en
dat's a foreign country. NOW, den! do dey put a tax on dat blessin'?”

“No, they don't.”

“Course dey don't; en so it stan' to reason dat you's mistaken, Mars
Tom. Dey wouldn't put de tax on po' truck like san', dat everybody ain't
'bleeged to have, en leave it off'n de bes' thing dey is, which nobody
can't git along widout.”

Tom Sawyer was stumped; he see Jim had got him where he couldn't budge.
He tried to wiggle out by saying they had FORGOT to put on that tax, but
they'd be sure to remember about it, next session of Congress, and then
they'd put it on, but that was a poor lame come-off, and he knowed it.
He said there warn't nothing foreign that warn't taxed but just that
one, and so they couldn't be consistent without taxing it, and to be
consistent was the first law of politics. So he stuck to it that they'd
left it out unintentional and would be certain to do their best to fix
it before they got caught and laughed at.

But I didn't feel no more interest in such things, as long as we
couldn't git our sand through, and it made me low-spirited, and Jim the
same. Tom he tried to cheer us up by saying he would think up another
speculation for us that would be just as good as this one and better,
but it didn't do no good, we didn't believe there was any as big as
this. It was mighty hard; such a little while ago we was so rich, and
could 'a' bought a country and started a kingdom and been celebrated and
happy, and now we was so poor and ornery again, and had our sand left
on our hands. The sand was looking so lovely before, just like gold and
di'monds, and the feel of it was so soft and so silky and nice, but now
I couldn't bear the sight of it, it made me sick to look at it, and I
knowed I wouldn't ever feel comfortable again till we got shut of it,
and I didn't have it there no more to remind us of what we had been and
what we had got degraded down to. The others was feeling the same way
about it that I was. I knowed it, because they cheered up so, the minute
I says le's throw this truck overboard.

Well, it was going to be work, you know, and pretty solid work, too; so
Tom he divided it up according to fairness and strength. He said me and
him would clear out a fifth apiece of the sand, and Jim three-fifths.
Jim he didn't quite like that arrangement. He says:

“Course I's de stronges', en I's willin' to do a share accordin', but by
jings you's kinder pilin' it onto ole Jim, Mars Tom, hain't you?”

“Well, I didn't think so, Jim, but you try your hand at fixing it, and
let's see.”

So Jim reckoned it wouldn't be no more than fair if me and Tom done a
TENTH apiece. Tom he turned his back to git room and be private, and
then he smole a smile that spread around and covered the whole Sahara to
the westward, back to the Atlantic edge of it where we come from. Then
he turned around again and said it was a good enough arrangement, and we
was satisfied if Jim was. Jim said he was.

So then Tom measured off our two-tenths in the bow and left the rest for
Jim, and it surprised Jim a good deal to see how much difference there
was and what a raging lot of sand his share come to, and said he
was powerful glad now that he had spoke up in time and got the first
arrangement altered, for he said that even the way it was now, there was
more sand than enjoyment in his end of the contract, he believed.

Then we laid into it. It was mighty hot work, and tough; so hot we had
to move up into cooler weather or we couldn't 'a' stood it. Me and Tom
took turn about, and one worked while t'other rested, but there warn't
nobody to spell poor old Jim, and he made all that part of Africa damp,
he sweated so. We couldn't work good, we was so full of laugh, and Jim
he kept fretting and wanting to know what tickled us so, and we had
to keep making up things to account for it, and they was pretty poor
inventions, but they done well enough, Jim didn't see through them.
At last when we got done we was 'most dead, but not with work but with
laughing. By and by Jim was 'most dead, too, but: it was with work; then
we took turns and spelled him, and he was as thankfull as he could be,
and would set on the gunnel and swab the sweat, and heave and pant, and
say how good we was to a poor old nigger, and he wouldn't ever forgit
us. He was always the gratefulest nigger I ever see, for any little
thing you done for him. He was only nigger outside; inside he was as
white as you be.



CHAPTER XII. JIM STANDING SIEGE

THE next few meals was pretty sandy, but that don't make no difference
when you are hungry; and when you ain't it ain't no satisfaction to eat,
anyway, and so a little grit in the meat ain't no particular drawback,
as far as I can see.

Then we struck the east end of the Desert at last, sailing on a
northeast course. Away off on the edge of the sand, in a soft pinky
light, we see three little sharp roofs like tents, and Tom says:

“It's the pyramids of Egypt.”

It made my heart fairly jump. You see, I had seen a many and a many a
picture of them, and heard tell about them a hundred times, and yet to
come on them all of a sudden, that way, and find they was REAL, 'stead
of imaginations, 'most knocked the breath out of me with surprise. It's
a curious thing, that the more you hear about a grand and big and bully
thing or person, the more it kind of dreamies out, as you may say, and
gets to be a big dim wavery figger made out of moonshine and nothing
solid to it. It's just so with George Washington, and the same with them
pyramids.

And moreover, besides, the thing they always said about them seemed to
me to be stretchers. There was a feller come to the Sunday-school once,
and had a picture of them, and made a speech, and said the biggest
pyramid covered thirteen acres, and was most five hundred foot high,
just a steep mountain, all built out of hunks of stone as big as a
bureau, and laid up in perfectly regular layers, like stair-steps.
Thirteen acres, you see, for just one building; it's a farm. If it
hadn't been in Sunday-school, I would 'a' judged it was a lie; and
outside I was certain of it. And he said there was a hole in the
pyramid, and you could go in there with candles, and go ever so far up
a long slanting tunnel, and come to a large room in the stomach of that
stone mountain, and there you would find a big stone chest with a king
in it, four thousand years old. I said to myself, then, if that ain't
a lie I will eat that king if they will fetch him, for even Methusalem
warn't that old, and nobody claims it.

As we come a little nearer we see the yaller sand come to an end in
a long straight edge like a blanket, and on to it was joined, edge
to edge, a wide country of bright green, with a snaky stripe crooking
through it, and Tom said it was the Nile. It made my heart jump again,
for the Nile was another thing that wasn't real to me. Now I can tell
you one thing which is dead certain: if you will fool along over three
thousand miles of yaller sand, all glimmering with heat so that it makes
your eyes water to look at it, and you've been a considerable part of
a week doing it, the green country will look so like home and heaven to
you that it will make your eyes water AGAIN.

It was just so with me, and the same with Jim.

And when Jim got so he could believe it WAS the land of Egypt he was
looking at, he wouldn't enter it standing up, but got down on his knees
and took off his hat, because he said it wasn't fitten' for a humble
poor nigger to come any other way where such men had been as Moses and
Joseph and Pharaoh and the other prophets. He was a Presbyterian, and
had a most deep respect for Moses which was a Presbyterian, too, he
said. He was all stirred up, and says:

“Hit's de lan' of Egypt, de lan' of Egypt, en I's 'lowed to look at
it wid my own eyes! En dah's de river dat was turn' to blood, en I's
looking at de very same groun' whah de plagues was, en de lice, en de
frogs, en de locus', en de hail, en whah dey marked de door-pos', en de
angel o' de Lord come by in de darkness o' de night en slew de fust-born
in all de lan' o' Egypt. Ole Jim ain't worthy to see dis day!”

And then he just broke down and cried, he was so thankful. So between
him and Tom there was talk enough, Jim being excited because the
land was so full of history--Joseph and his brethren, Moses in the
bulrushers, Jacob coming down into Egypt to buy corn, the silver cup in
the sack, and all them interesting things; and Tom just as excited too,
because the land was so full of history that was in HIS line, about
Noureddin, and Bedreddin, and such like monstrous giants, that made
Jim's wool rise, and a raft of other Arabian Nights folks, which the
half of them never done the things they let on they done, I don't
believe.

Then we struck a disappointment, for one of them early morning fogs
started up, and it warn't no use to sail over the top of it, because we
would go by Egypt, sure, so we judged it was best to set her by compass
straight for the place where the pyramids was gitting blurred and
blotted out, and then drop low and skin along pretty close to the ground
and keep a sharp lookout. Tom took the hellum, I stood by to let go the
anchor, and Jim he straddled the bow to dig through the fog with his
eyes and watch out for danger ahead. We went along a steady gait, but
not very fast, and the fog got solider and solider, so solid that Jim
looked dim and ragged and smoky through it. It was awful still, and we
talked low and was anxious. Now and then Jim would say:

“Highst her a p'int, Mars Tom, highst her!” and up she would skip, a
foot or two, and we would slide right over a flat-roofed mud cabin, with
people that had been asleep on it just beginning to turn out and gap
and stretch; and once when a feller was clear up on his hind legs so he
could gap and stretch better, we took him a blip in the back and knocked
him off. By and by, after about an hour, and everything dead still
and we a-straining our ears for sounds and holding our breath, the fog
thinned a little, very sudden, and Jim sung out in an awful scare:

“Oh, for de lan's sake, set her back, Mars Tom, here's de biggest giant
outen de 'Rabian Nights a-comin' for us!” and he went over backwards in
the boat.

Tom slammed on the back-action, and as we slowed to a standstill a man's
face as big as our house at home looked in over the gunnel, same as a
house looks out of its windows, and I laid down and died. I must 'a'
been clear dead and gone for as much as a minute or more; then I come
to, and Tom had hitched a boat-hook on to the lower lip of the giant and
was holding the balloon steady with it whilst he canted his head back
and got a good long look up at that awful face.

Jim was on his knees with his hands clasped, gazing up at the thing in a
begging way, and working his lips, but not getting anything out. I took
only just a glimpse, and was fading out again, but Tom says:

“He ain't alive, you fools; it's the Sphinx!”

I never see Tom look so little and like a fly; but that was because
the giant's head was so big and awful. Awful, yes, so it was, but not
dreadful any more, because you could see it was a noble face, and kind
of sad, and not thinking about you, but about other things and larger.
It was stone, reddish stone, and its nose and ears battered, and that
give it an abused look, and you felt sorrier for it for that.

We stood off a piece, and sailed around it and over it, and it was just
grand. It was a man's head, or maybe a woman's, on a tiger's body a
hundred and twenty-five foot long, and there was a dear little temple
between its front paws. All but the head used to be under the sand, for
hundreds of years, maybe thousands, but they had just lately dug the
sand away and found that little temple. It took a power of sand to bury
that cretur; most as much as it would to bury a steamboat, I reckon.

We landed Jim on top of the head, with an American flag to protect him,
it being a foreign land; then we sailed off to this and that and
t'other distance, to git what Tom called effects and perspectives
and proportions, and Jim he done the best he could, striking all the
different kinds of attitudes and positions he could study up, but
standing on his head and working his legs the way a frog does was the
best. The further we got away, the littler Jim got, and the grander
the Sphinx got, till at last it was only a clothespin on a dome, as
you might say. That's the way perspective brings out the correct
proportions, Tom said; he said Julus Cesar's niggers didn't know how big
he was, they was too close to him.

Then we sailed off further and further, till we couldn't see Jim at all
any more, and then that great figger was at its noblest, a-gazing out
over the Nile Valley so still and solemn and lonesome, and all the
little shabby huts and things that was scattered about it clean
disappeared and gone, and nothing around it now but a soft wide spread
of yaller velvet, which was the sand.

That was the right place to stop, and we done it. We set there a-looking
and a-thinking for a half an hour, nobody a-saying anything, for it made
us feel quiet and kind of solemn to remember it had been looking over
that valley just that same way, and thinking its awful thoughts all to
itself for thousands of years, and nobody can't find out what they are
to this day.

At last I took up the glass and see some little black things a-capering
around on that velvet carpet, and some more a-climbing up the cretur's
back, and then I see two or three wee puffs of white smoke, and told Tom
to look. He done it, and says:

“They're bugs. No--hold on; they--why, I believe they're men. Yes, it's
men--men and horses both. They're hauling a long ladder up onto the
Sphinx's back--now ain't that odd? And now they're trying to lean it
up a--there's some more puffs of smoke--it's guns! Huck, they're after
Jim.”

We clapped on the power, and went for them a-biling. We was there in
no time, and come a-whizzing down amongst them, and they broke and
scattered every which way, and some that was climbing the ladder after
Jim let go all holts and fell. We soared up and found him laying on top
of the head panting and most tuckered out, partly from howling for help
and partly from scare. He had been standing a siege a long time--a week,
HE said, but it warn't so, it only just seemed so to him because they
was crowding him so. They had shot at him, and rained the bullets all
around him, but he warn't hit, and when they found he wouldn't stand up
and the bullets couldn't git at him when he was laying down, they went
for the ladder, and then he knowed it was all up with him if we didn't
come pretty quick. Tom was very indignant, and asked him why he didn't
show the flag and command them to GIT, in the name of the United States.
Jim said he done it, but they never paid no attention. Tom said he would
have this thing looked into at Washington, and says:

“You'll see that they'll have to apologize for insulting the flag, and
pay an indemnity, too, on top of it even if they git off THAT easy.”

Jim says:

“What's an indemnity, Mars Tom?”

“It's cash, that's what it is.”

“Who gits it, Mars Tom?”

“Why, WE do.”

“En who gits de apology?”

“The United States. Or, we can take whichever we please. We can take the
apology, if we want to, and let the gov'ment take the money.”

“How much money will it be, Mars Tom?”

“Well, in an aggravated case like this one, it will be at least three
dollars apiece, and I don't know but more.”

“Well, den, we'll take de money, Mars Tom, blame de 'pology. Hain't dat
yo' notion, too? En hain't it yourn, Huck?”

We talked it over a little and allowed that that was as good a way as
any, so we agreed to take the money. It was a new business to me, and I
asked Tom if countries always apologized when they had done wrong, and
he says:

“Yes; the little ones does.”

We was sailing around examining the pyramids, you know, and now we
soared up and roosted on the flat top of the biggest one, and found it
was just like what the man said in the Sunday-school. It was like four
pairs of stairs that starts broad at the bottom and slants up and comes
together in a point at the top, only these stair-steps couldn't be clumb
the way you climb other stairs; no, for each step was as high as your
chin, and you have to be boosted up from behind. The two other pyramids
warn't far away, and the people moving about on the sand between looked
like bugs crawling, we was so high above them.

Tom he couldn't hold himself he was so worked up with gladness and
astonishment to be in such a celebrated place, and he just dripped
history from every pore, seemed to me. He said he couldn't scarcely
believe he was standing on the very identical spot the prince flew
from on the Bronze Horse. It was in the Arabian Night times, he said.
Somebody give the prince a bronze horse with a peg in its shoulder, and
he could git on him and fly through the air like a bird, and go all over
the world, and steer it by turning the peg, and fly high or low and land
wherever he wanted to.

When he got done telling it there was one of them uncomfortable silences
that comes, you know, when a person has been telling a whopper and you
feel sorry for him and wish you could think of some way to change the
subject and let him down easy, but git stuck and don't see no way, and
before you can pull your mind together and DO something, that silence
has got in and spread itself and done the business. I was embarrassed,
Jim he was embarrassed, and neither of us couldn't say a word. Well, Tom
he glowered at me a minute, and says:

“Come, out with it. What do you think?”

I says:

“Tom Sawyer, YOU don't believe that, yourself.”

“What's the reason I don't? What's to hender me?”

“There's one thing to hender you: it couldn't happen, that's all.”

“What's the reason it couldn't happen?”

“You tell me the reason it COULD happen.”

“This balloon is a good enough reason it could happen, I should reckon.”

“WHY is it?”

“WHY is it? I never saw such an idiot. Ain't this balloon and the bronze
horse the same thing under different names?”

“No, they're not. One is a balloon and the other's a horse. It's very
different. Next you'll be saying a house and a cow is the same thing.”

“By Jackson, Huck's got him ag'in! Dey ain't no wigglin' outer dat!”

“Shut your head, Jim; you don't know what you're talking about. And
Huck don't. Look here, Huck, I'll make it plain to you, so you can
understand. You see, it ain't the mere FORM that's got anything to do
with their being similar or unsimilar, it's the PRINCIPLE involved; and
the principle is the same in both. Don't you see, now?”

I turned it over in my mind, and says:

“Tom, it ain't no use. Principles is all very well, but they don't git
around that one big fact, that the thing that a balloon can do ain't no
sort of proof of what a horse can do.”

“Shucks, Huck, you don't get the idea at all. Now look here a
minute--it's perfectly plain. Don't we fly through the air?”

“Yes.”

“Very well. Don't we fly high or fly low, just as we please?”

“Yes.”

“Don't we steer whichever way we want to?”

“Yes.”

“And don't we land when and where we please?”

“Yes.”

“How do we move the balloon and steer it?”

“By touching the buttons.”

“NOW I reckon the thing is clear to you at last. In the other case the
moving and steering was done by turning a peg. We touch a button, the
prince turned a peg. There ain't an atom of difference, you see. I
knowed I could git it through your head if I stuck to it long enough.”

He felt so happy he begun to whistle. But me and Jim was silent, so he
broke off surprised, and says:

“Looky here, Huck Finn, don't you see it YET?”

I says:

“Tom Sawyer, I want to ask you some questions.”

“Go ahead,” he says, and I see Jim chirk up to listen.

“As I understand it, the whole thing is in the buttons and the peg--the
rest ain't of no consequence. A button is one shape, a peg is another
shape, but that ain't any matter?”

“No, that ain't any matter, as long as they've both got the same power.”

“All right, then. What is the power that's in a candle and in a match?”

“It's the fire.”

“It's the same in both, then?”

“Yes, just the same in both.”

“All right. Suppose I set fire to a carpenter shop with a match, what
will happen to that carpenter shop?”

“She'll burn up.”

“And suppose I set fire to this pyramid with a candle--will she burn
up?”

“Of course she won't.”

“All right. Now the fire's the same, both times. WHY does the shop burn,
and the pyramid don't?”

“Because the pyramid CAN'T burn.”

“Aha! and A HORSE CAN'T FLY!”

“My lan', ef Huck ain't got him ag'in! Huck's landed him high en dry
dis time, I tell you! Hit's de smartes' trap I ever see a body walk
inter--en ef I--”

But Jim was so full of laugh he got to strangling and couldn't go on,
and Tom was that mad to see how neat I had floored him, and turned his
own argument ag'in him and knocked him all to rags and flinders with it,
that all he could manage to say was that whenever he heard me and
Jim try to argue it made him ashamed of the human race. I never said
nothing; I was feeling pretty well satisfied. When I have got the best
of a person that way, it ain't my way to go around crowing about it
the way some people does, for I consider that if I was in his place I
wouldn't wish him to crow over me. It's better to be generous, that's
what I think.



CHAPTER XIII. GOING FOR TOM'S PIPE:

BY AND BY we left Jim to float around up there in the neighborhood
of the pyramids, and we clumb down to the hole where you go into the
tunnel, and went in with some Arabs and candles, and away in there in
the middle of the pyramid we found a room and a big stone box in it
where they used to keep that king, just as the man in the Sunday-school
said; but he was gone, now; somebody had got him. But I didn't take no
interest in the place, because there could be ghosts there, of course;
not fresh ones, but I don't like no kind.

So then we come out and got some little donkeys and rode a piece, and
then went in a boat another piece, and then more donkeys, and got to
Cairo; and all the way the road was as smooth and beautiful a road as
ever I see, and had tall date-pa'ms on both sides, and naked children
everywhere, and the men was as red as copper, and fine and strong and
handsome. And the city was a curiosity. Such narrow streets--why, they
were just lanes, and crowded with people with turbans, and women with
veils, and everybody rigged out in blazing bright clothes and all sorts
of colors, and you wondered how the camels and the people got by each
other in such narrow little cracks, but they done it--a perfect jam, you
see, and everybody noisy. The stores warn't big enough to turn around
in, but you didn't have to go in; the storekeeper sat tailor fashion on
his counter, smoking his snaky long pipe, and had his things where he
could reach them to sell, and he was just as good as in the street, for
the camel-loads brushed him as they went by.

Now and then a grand person flew by in a carriage with fancy dressed men
running and yelling in front of it and whacking anybody with a long rod
that didn't get out of the way. And by and by along comes the Sultan
riding horseback at the head of a procession, and fairly took your
breath away his clothes was so splendid; and everybody fell flat and
laid on his stomach while he went by. I forgot, but a feller helped me
to remember. He was one that had a rod and run in front.

There was churches, but they don't know enough to keep Sunday; they keep
Friday and break the Sabbath. You have to take off your shoes when you
go in. There was crowds of men and boys in the church, setting in groups
on the stone floor and making no end of noise--getting their lessons
by heart, Tom said, out of the Koran, which they think is a Bible, and
people that knows better knows enough to not let on. I never see such a
big church in my life before, and most awful high, it was; it made you
dizzy to look up; our village church at home ain't a circumstance to it;
if you was to put it in there, people would think it was a drygoods box.

What I wanted to see was a dervish, because I was interested in
dervishes on accounts of the one that played the trick on the
camel-driver. So we found a lot in a kind of a church, and they called
themselves Whirling Dervishes; and they did whirl, too. I never
see anything like it. They had tall sugar-loaf hats on, and linen
petticoats; and they spun and spun and spun, round and round like tops,
and the petticoats stood out on a slant, and it was the prettiest thing
I ever see, and made me drunk to look at it. They was all Moslems, Tom
said, and when I asked him what a Moslem was, he said it was a person
that wasn't a Presbyterian. So there is plenty of them in Missouri,
though I didn't know it before.

We didn't see half there was to see in Cairo, because Tom was in such a
sweat to hunt out places that was celebrated in history. We had a most
tiresome time to find the granary where Joseph stored up the grain
before the famine, and when we found it it warn't worth much to look
at, being such an old tumble-down wreck; but Tom was satisfied, and made
more fuss over it than I would make if I stuck a nail in my foot. How
he ever found that place was too many for me. We passed as much as forty
just like it before we come to it, and any of them would 'a' done for
me, but none but just the right one would suit him; I never see anybody
so particular as Tom Sawyer. The minute he struck the right one he
reconnized it as easy as I would reconnize my other shirt if I had one,
but how he done it he couldn't any more tell than he could fly; he said
so himself.

Then we hunted a long time for the house where the boy lived that
learned the cadi how to try the case of the old olives and the new ones,
and said it was out of the Arabian Nights, and he would tell me and Jim
about it when he got time. Well, we hunted and hunted till I was ready
to drop, and I wanted Tom to give it up and come next day and git
somebody that knowed the town and could talk Missourian and could go
straight to the place; but no, he wanted to find it himself, and nothing
else would answer. So on we went. Then at last the remarkablest
thing happened I ever see. The house was gone--gone hundreds of years
ago--every last rag of it gone but just one mud brick. Now a person
wouldn't ever believe that a backwoods Missouri boy that hadn't ever
been in that town before could go and hunt that place over and find that
brick, but Tom Sawyer done it. I know he done it, because I see him do
it. I was right by his very side at the time, and see him see the brick
and see him reconnize it. Well, I says to myself, how DOES he do it? Is
it knowledge, or is it instink?

Now there's the facts, just as they happened: let everybody explain it
their own way. I've ciphered over it a good deal, and it's my opinion
that some of it is knowledge but the main bulk of it is instink. The
reason is this: Tom put the brick in his pocket to give to a museum with
his name on it and the facts when he went home, and I slipped it out and
put another brick considerable like it in its place, and he didn't
know the difference--but there was a difference, you see. I think that
settles it--it's mostly instink, not knowledge. Instink tells him where
the exact PLACE is for the brick to be in, and so he reconnizes it by
the place it's in, not by the look of the brick. If it was knowledge,
not instink, he would know the brick again by the look of it the next
time he seen it--which he didn't. So it shows that for all the brag
you hear about knowledge being such a wonderful thing, instink is worth
forty of it for real unerringness. Jim says the same.

When we got back Jim dropped down and took us in, and there was a young
man there with a red skullcap and tassel on and a beautiful silk jacket
and baggy trousers with a shawl around his waist and pistols in it that
could talk English and wanted to hire to us as guide and take us to
Mecca and Medina and Central Africa and everywheres for a half a dollar
a day and his keep, and we hired him and left, and piled on the power,
and by the time we was through dinner we was over the place where the
Israelites crossed the Red Sea when Pharaoh tried to overtake them and
was caught by the waters. We stopped, then, and had a good look at the
place, and it done Jim good to see it. He said he could see it all,
now, just the way it happened; he could see the Israelites walking along
between the walls of water, and the Egyptians coming, from away off
yonder, hurrying all they could, and see them start in as the Israelites
went out, and then when they was all in, see the walls tumble together
and drown the last man of them. Then we piled on the power again and
rushed away and huvvered over Mount Sinai, and saw the place where Moses
broke the tables of stone, and where the children of Israel camped
in the plain and worshiped the golden calf, and it was all just as
interesting as could be, and the guide knowed every place as well as I
knowed the village at home.

But we had an accident, now, and it fetched all the plans to a
standstill. Tom's old ornery corn-cob pipe had got so old and swelled
and warped that she couldn't hold together any longer, notwithstanding
the strings and bandages, but caved in and went to pieces. Tom he
didn't know WHAT to do. The professor's pipe wouldn't answer; it warn't
anything but a mershum, and a person that's got used to a cob pipe knows
it lays a long ways over all the other pipes in this world, and you
can't git him to smoke any other. He wouldn't take mine, I couldn't
persuade him. So there he was.

He thought it over, and said we must scour around and see if we could
roust out one in Egypt or Arabia or around in some of these countries,
but the guide said no, it warn't no use, they didn't have them. So Tom
was pretty glum for a little while, then he chirked up and said he'd got
the idea and knowed what to do. He says:

“I've got another corn-cob pipe, and it's a prime one, too, and nearly
new. It's laying on the rafter that's right over the kitchen stove at
home in the village. Jim, you and the guide will go and get it, and me
and Huck will camp here on Mount Sinai till you come back.”

“But, Mars Tom, we couldn't ever find de village. I could find de pipe,
'case I knows de kitchen, but my lan', we can't ever find de village,
nur Sent Louis, nur none o' dem places. We don't know de way, Mars Tom.”

That was a fact, and it stumped Tom for a minute. Then he said:

“Looky here, it can be done, sure; and I'll tell you how. You set your
compass and sail west as straight as a dart, till you find the United
States. It ain't any trouble, because it's the first land you'll strike
the other side of the Atlantic. If it's daytime when you strike it,
bulge right on, straight west from the upper part of the Florida
coast, and in an hour and three quarters you'll hit the mouth of the
Mississippi--at the speed that I'm going to send you. You'll be so high
up in the air that the earth will be curved considerable--sorter like
a washbowl turned upside down--and you'll see a raft of rivers crawling
around every which way, long before you get there, and you can pick out
the Mississippi without any trouble. Then you can follow the river north
nearly, an hour and three quarters, till you see the Ohio come in; then
you want to look sharp, because you're getting near. Away up to your
left you'll see another thread coming in--that's the Missouri and is a
little above St. Louis. You'll come down low then, so as you can examine
the villages as you spin along. You'll pass about twenty-five in the
next fifteen minutes, and you'll recognize ours when you see it--and if
you don't, you can yell down and ask.”

“Ef it's dat easy, Mars Tom, I reckon we kin do it--yassir, I knows we
kin.”

The guide was sure of it, too, and thought that he could learn to stand
his watch in a little while.

“Jim can learn you the whole thing in a half an hour,” Tom said. “This
balloon's as easy to manage as a canoe.”

Tom got out the chart and marked out the course and measured it, and
says:

“To go back west is the shortest way, you see. It's only about seven
thousand miles. If you went east, and so on around, it's over twice as
far.” Then he says to the guide, “I want you both to watch the tell-tale
all through the watches, and whenever it don't mark three hundred miles
an hour, you go higher or drop lower till you find a storm-current
that's going your way. There's a hundred miles an hour in this old thing
without any wind to help. There's two-hundred-mile gales to be found,
any time you want to hunt for them.”

“We'll hunt for them, sir.”

“See that you do. Sometimes you may have to go up a couple of miles, and
it'll be p'ison cold, but most of the time you'll find your storm a good
deal lower. If you can only strike a cyclone--that's the ticket for
you! You'll see by the professor's books that they travel west in these
latitudes; and they travel low, too.”

Then he ciphered on the time, and says--

“Seven thousand miles, three hundred miles an hour--you can make the
trip in a day--twenty-four hours. This is Thursday; you'll be back here
Saturday afternoon. Come, now, hustle out some blankets and food and
books and things for me and Huck, and you can start right along. There
ain't no occasion to fool around--I want a smoke, and the quicker you
fetch that pipe the better.”

All hands jumped for the things, and in eight minutes our things was out
and the balloon was ready for America. So we shook hands good-bye, and
Tom gave his last orders:

“It's 10 minutes to 2 P.M. now, Mount Sinai time. In 24 hours you'll be
home, and it'll be 6 to-morrow morning, village time. When you strike
the village, land a little back of the top of the hill, in the woods,
out of sight; then you rush down, Jim, and shove these letters in the
post-office, and if you see anybody stirring, pull your slouch down over
your face so they won't know you. Then you go and slip in the back way
to the kitchen and git the pipe, and lay this piece of paper on the
kitchen table, and put something on it to hold it, and then slide out
and git away, and don't let Aunt Polly catch a sight of you, nor nobody
else. Then you jump for the balloon and shove for Mount Sinai three
hundred miles an hour. You won't have lost more than an hour. You'll
start back at 7 or 8 A.M., village time, and be here in 24 hours,
arriving at 2 or 3 P.M., Mount Sinai time.”

Tom he read the piece of paper to us. He had wrote on it:

     “THURSDAY AFTERNOON. Tom Sawyer the Erro-nort
     sends his love to Aunt Polly from Mount Sinai
     where the Ark was, and so does Huck Finn, and she
     will get it to-morrow morning half-past six.” *

  [* This misplacing of the Ark is probably Huck's   error, not
     Tom's.--M.T.]

“That'll make her eyes bulge out and the tears come,” he says. Then he
says:

“Stand by! One--two--three--away you go!”

And away she DID go! Why, she seemed to whiz out of sight in a second.

Then we found a most comfortable cave that looked out over the whole big
plain, and there we camped to wait for the pipe.

The balloon come back all right, and brung the pipe; but Aunt Polly had
catched Jim when he was getting it, and anybody can guess what happened:
she sent for Tom. So Jim he says:

“Mars Tom, she's out on de porch wid her eye sot on de sky a-layin' for
you, en she say she ain't gwyne to budge from dah tell she gits hold of
you. Dey's gwyne to be trouble, Mars Tom, 'deed dey is.”

So then we shoved for home, and not feeling very gay, neither.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
